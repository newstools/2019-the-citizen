On a gloomy day for local cricket, with Cricket South Africa attempting to gag five prominent cricket writers, there was a timely reminder of the magic of a duel between two legends.
AB de Villiers and Dale Steyn, arguably Proteas without peer, faced off in Sunday’s MSL meeting between the Tshwane Spartans and Cape Town Blitz at Newlands.
De Villiers, as has happened so many times during his career, was the man keeping the Spartans afloat, before Steyn intervened with a fine over to him, culminating in a wicket off the last ball of his spell.
The 35-year-old quick ended with a magnificent haul of 3/10 as De Villiers was dismissed for 31.
The Blitz won by 15 runs.
Thrilling stuff.
