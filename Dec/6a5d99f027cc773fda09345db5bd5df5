Graeme Smith’s first order of business at his official unveiling as Cricket South Africa’s interim director of cricket on Saturday will be the announcement of Mark Boucher as the Proteas’ new team director, according to multiple reports.
The legendary wicketkeeper has been the Titans’ head coach since the start of the 2016/17 season and has continued the franchise’s tradition of collecting trophies, winning four titles during that time.
SA Cricket Magazine on Friday reported that Boucher didn’t fly to Port Elizabeth with his MSL franchise, Tshwane Spartans, for their playoff with the Nelson Mandela Bay Giants in order to conclude his negotiations with the embattled governing body.
Given the amount of national players he’s had to deal with at the Titans, as well as juggle their availability, Boucher certainly wouldn’t be out of place cultivating relationships with squad members.
He also played 147 Tests and 293 ODIs, making him intimately familiar with the demands of international cricket.
Meanwhile, ESPNCricinfo claims that Enoch Nkwe, the national team’s interim team director on their disastrous tour to India, will remain with the side as Boucher’s assistant.

The specialist website cited a source saying the pair are “keen” to form a partnership.
To complete an almost Protea-takeover of the Proteas, Smith is also in talks with Jacques Kallis as batting coach for the team.
Should that happen, three key members of South Africa’s drive towards being the top-ranked Test side in world in 2012 will now be involved in a challenging time for the team, with the Test series against England starting in less than two weeks’ time.
