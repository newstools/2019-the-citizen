Already seen as a pre-production prototype hiding its new hardware underneath the skin of a current generation Range Rover Sport, a new report from the United Kingdom has alleged that the forthcoming, all-new full-size Range Rover will join the Jaguar XJ in offering a dedicated all-electric model.
While it is understood that the fifth generation will once again be offered with a selection of petrol and diesel engines, the former set to be sourced from BMW, Britain’s Car Magazine claims it will be underpinned by the new MLA platform earmarked for the XJ, which has been designed to accommodate internal combustion motors with or without hybrid assistance, as well as pure electric power.
Based on the claims, electric derivatives could feature a 90 kWh battery pack, but according to Jaguar Land Rover’s Global Vehicle Line Director, Nick Collins, the introduction of the would not result in the model’s off-road prowess being diluted.
“On the road, the increased refinement and silent running [of an electrified powertrain] excites me and off-road, you get peak torque at zero revs together with much more accurate control,” Collins said.
While still to be confirmed outright, the British publication anticipates the newcomer to make its official unveiling in 2022.
