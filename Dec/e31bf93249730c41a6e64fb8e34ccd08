Audi has unveiled a special anniversary package in Germany to celebrate 25 years of its first ever RS model, the RS2 Avant.
Available on the RS4 Avant, the RS5 Coupe and Sportback, the RS6 Avant, RS7 Sportback and the TT RS Coupe, the so-called “Anniversary Package 25 Years of RS”  mainly includes exterior and interior differences, with the most prominent being the Nagaro Blue Pearl effect hue that mirrors the colour of the RS2.

The exterior changes don’t stop there with all models receiving a matt aluminium finish for the front blade, door sills and rear diffuser, a gloss Singleframe grille, bumper vents and mirror caps, a special ‘25’ puddle lamp projected onto the ground when the doors are opened, a two-tone silver and gloss anthracite finish for the alloy wheels and three alternative colours; Glacier White, Mythos Black and Nardo Grey.
Inside, the bespoke touches includes an all-black interior with Cobalt Blue Alcantara detailing on the floor mats and 12 o’clock marking on the steering wheel, 25 year logos on the seats, door panels and floor mats, and RS Sport seats trimmed in fine Nappa leather with an Alcantara centre on the TT RS, RS4 and RS5, while those on the RS6 and RS7 are perforated and finished in Valcona leather with a visible blue shimmer.

Underneath each model’s bonnet, no changes have been enforced with the mild-hybrid 4.0 TFSI V8 in the RS6 and RS7 producing 441kW/800Nm and the 2.9 TFSI V6 in the RS4 and RS5 331kW/600Nm. The TT RS meanwhile keeps hold of its 2.5 TFSI that once again punches out 294kW/480Nm.

For now, the Anniversary package 25 years of RS is limited to Europe where it retails from €9 350 (R150 563) on the TT RS to €14 500 (R233 494) on the RS6 and RS7.
