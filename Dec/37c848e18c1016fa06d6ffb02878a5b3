Unfavourable weather conditions brought on by tropical storm Calvinia have forced Mauritius to close its only airport. 
All arrivals and departures have been postponed until further notice, Air Mauritius said in a statement on Monday morning. 
South African Airways (SAA) announced on Monday that flights SA190/MK950 from Johannesburg to Mauritius and SA191/MK949 from Mauritius to Johannesburg have been cancelled and that SAA plans to reinstate these flights on Tuesday.

“We have decided to add additional flights on Tuesday in order to accommodate as many passengers as possible who are affected by the cancellation on Monday. 
“SAA will operate two wide-bodied aircraft, an A330-200 (36 Business and 186 Economy class seats) and an A330-300 (46 Business and 203 Economy),” said SAA spokesperson, Tlali Tlali. 
He added that the Mauritius Meteorology Services (MMS) notified SAA that their airspace was closed due to the severity of the weather conditions and that SAA would support any operational decisions to prioritise safety. 
Customers will be kept informed about weather conditions in Mauritius.
