Family member to Springbok lock Eben Etzebeth Karla Etzebeth narrowly escaped an attack on the N1 highway in Cape Town where perpetrators threw a rock at close range towards her car.
Karla, who was driving home along the N1 near the M5 Koeberg turn-off on Saturday morning, escaped with bruises to her face after the stone was thrown.
The stone smashed her window and left her with minor injuries to her face. She describes the attack in an IOL report, detailing how the M5 road was riddled with stones on the road.
She works at the Waterfront and was driving home at around 3am when she saw rocks on the road.
Slowing down to analyse the situation, she was startled by four men who popped out of nowhere to throw stones at her car.
“One of the stones smashed my side window and hit me in the face. It happened so fast and I still don’t know how I, in that panic-stricken situation, reversed the car and managed to speed away from them.”
The matter was reported to the Bellville police station.
