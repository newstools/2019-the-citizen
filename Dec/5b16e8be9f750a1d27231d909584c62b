Thabang Moroe, Cricket South Africa’s controversial chief executive, on Tuesday took “full responsibility” for the “mishap” that was the attempted gagging of journalists at the weekend.
Five prominent cricket writers – including The Citizen’s Ken Borland – had their accreditation to stadium events revoked in response to critical reporting on the struggling federation.
Yet, according to Sport24, Moroe sent a letter to the South African National Editor’s Forum (Sanef) after the NPO demanded an apology on behalf of the journalists.
Moroe also personally contacted the five individuals.
The letter in full reads:
Again thank you for taking my call and giving me a moment in your busy schedule. As I alluded to you that as head of operations at Cricket South Africa I take full responsibility for what transpired over the weekend and that I don’t think such a drastic measure was necessary! With hindsight being the perfect vision one can easily think to have spared a few minutes in my day to try and personally get hold of the journalists and assess their position myself.
I have been in talks with all the journalists and personally apologized for the embarrassment they suffered, I have also committed to a “sit down” with them so we can have frank discussions around CSA and cricket. Mr Boland (sic) is currently on holiday and I haven’t been able to get hold of him but will continue trying him.
I take this opportunity to once more apologize, unreservedly so to you and your organization for the mishap and can assure you that it will not happen again!
Looking forward to meeting with you once we are able to sync our diaries so we can gingerly move forward together!
Kind regards,
Thabang Moroe CSA
