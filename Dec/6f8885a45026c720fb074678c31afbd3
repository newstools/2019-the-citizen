The Tshwane council sitting got off to a chaotic start following a decision by speaker Katlego Mathebe to recuse herself after a decision by the ANC to table a motion of no confidence against her.
Acting speaker Zweli Khumalo took over the reins but was interrupted by the EFF during the meeting where a motion of no confidence against Mathebe and suspended mayor Stevens Mokgalapa would be tabled.
Tshwane ANC council chairperson Kgosi Maepa, alongside ANC Tshwane chief whip Aaron Maluleka, outlined reasons why the party tabled the motions.
The objective was to vote against the speaker and the mayor, Maepa said.
He said the DA had limped from one scandal to another and had in the process undermined service delivery.
The ANC has, as a result, asked the Pan African Congress (PAC) as well as the Economic Freedom Fighters to work with them to vote out the executive mayor and speaker.
This was all in the process of a beginning to fix the metro, Maepa said.
