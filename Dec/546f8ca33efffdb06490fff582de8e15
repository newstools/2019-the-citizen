Mercedes-Benz has released the first teaser sketch of the long awaited, all-new GLA ahead of its world debut tomorrow (11 December).
The last model in the eight-car A-Class based range to be revealed, the GLA will be both lower and shorter than the A-Class hatch, and, based on the single sketch, receive subtle body cladding around the wheel arches, bigger alloy wheels and integrated roof rails.
As mentioned, it will be underpinned by the MFA2 front-wheel-drive platform used by A-Class hatch, sedan and the Chinese market A-Class Sedan L, as well as the CLA and CLA Shooting Brake, B-Class and the GLB.
Inside, the interior is set to be identical to that of its mentioned siblings with seating for five and not seven like the GLB. Despite its platform, the GLA will have the option of Benz’s 4Matic four-wheel-drive system and the same assortment of engines as the A-Class, including the performance AMG GLA 35 and the AMG GLA 45 and 45 S.
In spite of its unveiling having been pencilled in, expect final details and even images to be uncovered before the wraps are lifted.
