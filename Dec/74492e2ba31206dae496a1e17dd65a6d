Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) is reportedly mulling a sub Jeep Renegade sized crossover allegedly aimed at the Suzuki Jimny.
In an interview with Britain’s Auto Express, Jeep’s Marketing Head for Europe, Marco Pigozzi, said the small crossover could be introduced as early as 2022 but unlike the Jimny, possibly with the option of electrification if FCA’s merger with the PSA Group becomes a reality.
“The car will be able to be used as a bad-ass Jeep, but it has also been designed to be used everyday,” he said, before adding that “we have the capability to deliver the electrification we need”.
While the publication reports that the model could ride on a modified version of the CMP platform used by the DS 3 Crossback, Opel Corsa and the Peugeot 208 as well as the 2008, with four-wheel-drive likely to be provided by a rear-axle mounted electric motor, the unit itself could be Jeep’s own following FCA’s recent investment of $1.6-billion into the once dormant Mack Avenue Engine Plant in Detroit that will also produce the all-new Grand Cherokee from the fourth quarter of next year.
