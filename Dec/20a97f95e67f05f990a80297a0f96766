The contract to manage the toll collection system – which was held by Austrian-connected company ETC – expired on Monday and, so far, there has been no indication of whether any of the three companies who tendered for the new contract have been successful or not.

If the authorities try to persecute non-payers – while at the same time doing nothing about the even higher non-payment rate for electricity by the residents of Soweto – then they could have even more of a revolt on their hands.
Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.
