The ANC Youth League (ANCYL) in KwaZulu-Natal on Tuesday issued a statement mourning the passing of a member of its provincial executive committee (PEC), Sindisiwe Ndlovu.
The ANCYL said it had learned “with shock” of Ndlovu’s “brutal killing”.
“The Youth League understands that comrade Sindi was shot and killed by her boyfriend in the early hours of the morning today, who has since been arrested by the law enforcement services,” the statement reads.
The spokesperson of the police in the province, Brigadier Jay Naicker, said Cramond SAPS were investigating a case of murder.
“It is alleged this morning at 3am at Thokozani area in Cramond, a 34-year-old woman was fatally shot by a known suspect after an argument. A 31-year-old suspect was placed under arrest for murder and the firearm used by the suspect was seized by police. The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated,” Naicker said.
The ANCYL said “comrade” Ndlovu “was a youth activist who dedicated her life to the service of young people in our country”.
“She has served in various capacities in both the Student Movement SASCO and the Youth Movement serving in the Provincial Executive Committee. She was soft-spoken but uncompromising in her beliefs of championing the interests of young people.
“The ANC Youth League calls on the full might of the law to be meted against the senseless murderer. We call on our government to intensify the fight against gender-based violence. The youth yearns for the day when gender-based violence will be spoken of as a bad chapter in the history of our country which no longer exists in society.
“We send our deepest condolences to the family, friends and the broad movement on the passing of comrade Sindi.
“Lala ngoxolo vukayibambhe.”
