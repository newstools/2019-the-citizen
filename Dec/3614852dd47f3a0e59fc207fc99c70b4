Phumelela confirmed on Friday that an agreement in principle had been reached with various interested parties to extend horseracing at Flamingo Park in Kimberley until at least the end of 2020.
“With the support of the Racing Association, Phumelela is in the process of concluding an agreement with Gold Circle that also involves Mrs Mary Slack and Hollywoodbets.”
The details of the agreement were still being finalised and full details would be released in due course.
“Phumelela is issuing this communication in the meanwhile because it’s vital to provide clarity on the immediate future of the venue as soon as possible, particularly for affected stakeholders in Kimberley.”
They thanked the Racing Association, Gold Circle, Slack and Hollywoodbets for enabling the company to jointly find a solution to keep horseracing alive in the Northern Cape.
