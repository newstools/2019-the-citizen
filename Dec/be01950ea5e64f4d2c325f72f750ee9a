Former Bulls prop Pierre Schoeman might’ve made a great impression in his first year with Scottish side Edinburgh, winning the side’s Player-of-the-Year award as well as scooping up a new contract.
But the 25-year-old has also been in the headlines for the wrong reasons after he engaged in an incredibly dangerous act during last weekend’s Pro 14 meeting with Irish giants Munster.
Schoeman lifted the padding to the right-hand upright while Edinburgh were on defence in a move cynically designed to prevent a try being scored.

This is insane. Mitrea says “drop it”, Schoeman ignores him and Mitrea just… plays on.

The rule book dictates that a team will score a five-pointer if a player places the ball at the base of the padding.
However, it’s also obviously there for safety too.
Referee Marius Mitrea was only made aware of the incident by Munster’s players afterwards, who bafflingly only have Schoeman a warning.
Munter coach and former Bok assistant Johann van Graan wasn’t impressed.
“In my view you can’t touch the goalposts,” he said.
“It is the safety of the game. You can’t pull that up; there’s been another incident in world rugby where that was a yellow and straight penalty try”
