Police in Limpopo said on Thursday they had intensified a manhunt for a 33-year-old father suspected of brutally killing his six-year-old son.
Police spokesperson Brigadier Motlafela Mojapelo said the 33-year-old was suspected to have killed his son at Ga-Ramoshoan Village outside Seshego, Limpopo, on the evening of December 8.
“The murder of the child allegedly took place at about 9pm at his father’s home following a heated telephonic argument between his parents, apparently over infidelity.
“The furious father, who was residing with his son while the mother was in Pretoria, allegedly took a sharp object and killed the child instantly. After the murder, he then fled the scene. The body was discovered by the relatives a few hours later inside the bedroom. The police were summoned and upon arrival, they started with their initial investigations, a suicide note was then found on the scene of the crime,” Mojapelo said.
The deceased has been identified as Mohau Evidence Choshi, he added.
