No loadshedding is expected on Monday although the system remains vulnerable, Eskom said in a statement.
“There is no loadshedding expected today as a result of a drop in demand during the holiday period and a return of some generating units to service. Eskom has since Sunday not utilized emergency diesel to supplement capacity. We, however, remind customers that as the system continues to remain vulnerable and unpredictable, the possibility of loadshedding remains.
The power utility continued to ask consumers to reduce demand as a “concerted collective effort can help to avoid or lessen the level of loadshedding.”


While Eskom gave assurances that there would be no load shedding on Saturday, many suburbs in Johannesburg and surrounding areas were left without power.
Eskom said it did not expect any load shedding during the day, despite experiencing “severely constrained” electricity system due to an unplanned breakdown.
It said it would continue to use emergency reserves to supplement capacity if necessary and warned customers that the system continued to be vulnerable and unpredictable.
Suburbs Allens Nek, Constantia Kloof, Honeydew, Radiokop, Ruimsig, Strubens Valley, Weltevreden Park, Little Falls, Wilgeheuwel, Lenasia South, Noordwyk, Alexandra, parts of the Johannesburg CBD, Newtown and others had no electricity for different durations on Saturday.
