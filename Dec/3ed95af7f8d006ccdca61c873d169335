A Warrant Officer was leaving his residence at Alfawood, Woodview for duties at SAPS Phoenix Police Station when a white Toyota Etios stopped in front of him.
An unidentified man alighted from the Etios, walked up to the Warrant Officer and shot several times at him. However, the policeman managed to return fire, killing the suspect instanlty. Sadly, the Warrant Officer also succumbed to his injuries.
The other suspect/s that were in the Etios then sped away.

“We, the police managenent, have made a clarion call to all our police officers never to fall with a gun in their hands. Our colleague fought a brave fight today but sadly he lost his life, but not without ensuring that his assailant went down too”, added General Masemola.
