Two taxis collided head-on on the N1 near Laingsburg around 5am, he said.
“In a secondary crash, a heavy motor vehicle ploughed through the crash scene allegedly killing one of the taxi drivers.”
He said seven others were slightly injured.
Both lanes were closed for traffic.
“We will do everything in our power to reopen the road as soon as possible.”
