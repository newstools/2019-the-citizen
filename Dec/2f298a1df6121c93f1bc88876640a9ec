An image of the Woolworths leadership team posted on the brand’s official Twitter account on December 23 after the team dropped by a Woolworths store to “help store staff during the Christmas rush” by packing groceries and doing other menial tasks in the store has sparked outrage for a lack of diversity.
The image, which features a range of Caucasian and Indian people, received a range of responses, some sarcastic, such as “I see the leadership represent proper racial demographic of the country”, “Diversity ????”, and “Hmm I can be the face of BEE in your leadership… PLEASE DM #BLACK&FEMALE.”












While the brand has been bombarded with queries about this all morning, they have only been responding to store-related customer complaints. They have yet to release a statement regarding the queries related to the picture, nor have they acknowledged them.
