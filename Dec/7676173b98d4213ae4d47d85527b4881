KZN Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant-General Khombinkosi Jula praised the team for the recovery of the firearms, and for the arrest of the alleged hitman. 
“We will endeavour with all the resources available to us to apprehend those involved in criminal activities within the taxi industry,” he said.
