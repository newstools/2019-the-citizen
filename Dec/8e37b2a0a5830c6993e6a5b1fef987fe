According to JMPD spokesperson Wayne Minnaar, no injuries have been reported and passengers were being treated for smoke inhalation.
Emergency services are currently battling the blaze, despite the fire having occurred about an hour ago.
Motorists can expect heavy delays with traffic being diverted through William Nicol, past Witkoppen and Rivonia Road, and back onto the N1, Minnaar said.
If possible, alternative routes should be utilised.
