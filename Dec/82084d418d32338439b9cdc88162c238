“It’s an ongoing problem, it didn’t start now,” he said.
However, Mbasane highlighted there were “measures” in place to deal with the problem since the beginning of the festive season.
“We put measures in place to protect motorists by patrolling the N4 road 24/7,” he said.
He said the patrols were conducted by police, metro police and highway patrols.
According to information received by Pretoria East Rekord, spikes were thrown on the highway along the N4 east, after Donkerhoek.
The spikes were aimed at damaging the tyres and forcing the vehicle to stop.
