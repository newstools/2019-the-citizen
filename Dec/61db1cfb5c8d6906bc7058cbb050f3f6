President Cyril Ramaphosa has reportedly cut his official visit to Egypt short and is on his way back to the country and is expected to meet with Eskom officials on Wednesday.
This after Eskom announced on Monday it would implement stage 6 load shedding.
EWN reports that the presidency has confirmed that Ramaphosa would meet with Eskom officials on Wednesday.
The Democratic Alliance (DA) on Tuesday called on Ramaphosa to come back to the country to “fix the electricity crisis” and “to provide leadership on this self-created crisis”.
DA interim leader John Steenhuisen said: “Ramaphosa should address parliament, taking the nation into his confidence as to what is really transpiring at Eskom. It is unprecedented in a month like a December with such low demand we have rolling blackouts at all – raising suspicion as to what the president is not telling the nation. It’s time to come clean on exactly what the structural problems at Eskom are and how his government plans to address them.”
The DA also called on Ramaphosa to fire energy minister Gwede Mantashe for the “crisis” at Eskom.
