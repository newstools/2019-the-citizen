In what is expected to be its final release for 2019, the European New Car Assessment Programme, otherwise known as Euro NCAP, has released its latest batch of vehicle assessments with eight of the 12 models tested earning the maximum five-stars.
Of the top rated models, only the Audi Q7 and Subaru Forester are offered in South Africa, with the incoming Peugeot 2008 bagging four stars, but with an additional star added when equipped with the optional safety package.
Bar the new Renault Captur and Porsche Taycan arriving next year, as well as the Ford Kuga that is still to be confirmed, the other models to receive safety’s highest grading included the recently revised Ford Mondeo, the new Skoda Octavia and the all-electric Tesla Model X, while the updated Volkswagen Sharan and its Seat equivalent, the Alhambra, both obtained four stars. The facelift Jeep Renegade’s lack of autonomous emergency braking however saw it receiving only three stars, the lowest of any model tested this year.
“Well done to Tesla and the other five stars performers for not only bringing best in class performance in testing but also making safety systems accessible and standard across the European market. It is also good to see manufacturers – Ford and Volkswagen in this case – standardising AEB and keeping safety up-to-date even for older cars, to the benefit of their customers,” Euro NCAP  Secretary General, Michiel van Ratingen, said in a statement.
“It’s a pity that not everyone follows this example, and by prioritising looks over substance Jeep ended up at the bottom of the list of this year’s rated cars. The good news is that consumers have more choice than ever to find a safer alternative”.
