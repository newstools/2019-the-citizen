BMW has given its flagship Z4, the M40i, a substantial power hike for 2020, but only in Australia for the time being. Although no changes to the $124 900 (R1 233 106) sticker price has been made, the 3.0-litre turbocharged straight-six B58 motor shared with the Toyota Supra has been spooled-up from 250 kW to the same 285 kW as the M340i xDrive, X3 M40i and X4 M40i with torque unchanged at 500 Nm.
Still hooked to the eight-speed sport Steptronic gearbox, the M40i’s performance figures has also gone down with 0-100 km/h now dealt with in 4.1 seconds as opposed to 4.5 seconds, while the claimed top speed is still limited to 250 km/h.
Arriving Down Under in April next year, it remains to be seen whether the upgrade will be applied to South African-spec M40i’s as well. Also uncertain is if BMW South Africa will see it fit to keep the price tag unchanged if the upgrade is approved, which will result in the M40i keeping its R1 036 699 sticker before options.
