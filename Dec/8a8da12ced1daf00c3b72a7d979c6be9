Eskom will implement stage 4 load shedding from 2pm on Friday, the utility’s spokesperson Nto Rikhotso has confirmed.
“For now, we will implement stage 4 load shedding between 2pm and 6am tomorrow. Should anything change, Eskom will advise consumers,” she said.
“Last night [Thursday] we implemented load shedding because we wanted to augment water resources. Some of the units we expected to come back [online] did not come back,” she told TimesLive.
“Further to that, this morning [Friday], because of the rain, we are starting to experience coal-handling issues because some stations now have wet coal, and thus more units are not able to generate.”
This follows Eskom not only continuing load shedding for far longer than initially advertised yesterday, with stage 2 continuing past 6am in some areas on Friday, but announcing it would be pulling the plug rotationally again for more stage 2 load shedding from 9am today until 6am on Saturday.
They said they had suffered “further unplanned breakdowns”.

The embattled power utility has once again been struggling with capacity after being hit by these “unplanned breakdowns” that went beyond the 10,500MW threshold.
They apologised to the country on Thursday and said that if people lowered their demand in a “concerted” way, it would help minimise strain on the grid.
However, a cold front and very wet weather has no doubt been putting pressure on the system.
Consumers have been advised to check their local schedules to see how they will be affected.
