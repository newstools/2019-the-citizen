A section of Kaizer Chiefs supporters, claim to have forgiven their club’s former player, George Lebese for being a “traitor” after he abandoned Amakhosi and signed for Mamelodi Sundowns and have started a petition to try and force the side’s management to give the player another chance at Naturena.

Lebese came clean last week during an interview with Robert Marawa and admitted that his decision to leave Chiefs where he was a regular and one of the fan favourites may have been misguided.
He failed to get into the first team at Chloorkop and after a frustrating two years, he decided to cut ties. He is currently a free agent.
“We know he hurt us when he left like that when we needed him as the team was struggling and didn’t have any big names which is unheard at Chiefs but we must forgive him because he has seen his mistakes. We started the online petition with the hope that we can make the club rethink their decision not to have him back when he became available,” said a source who is one of the people behind the petition.
Meanwhile, as reported earlier, Lebese is targeting a move in the January transfer window as he continues to keep fit by training on his own.
Lebese has been without a club since he was released by Sundowns in June.
