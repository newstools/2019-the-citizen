One lane in both directions of the N3 at Van Reenen is currently open for traffic, Ladysmith Gazette.
A dual-fuel tanker with a trailer carrying both petrol and diesel reportedly caught fire due to a mechanical failure on the N3 Toll Route while parked in a lay-by near the Pyramid Motel.
Fuel leaked across the road from the burning trailer, setting another four trucks alight.
