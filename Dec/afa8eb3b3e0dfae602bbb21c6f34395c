The Chief Operations Officer (COO) for Mitsubishi Australia has thrown his support behind the hybrid version of the Triton, saying that the market Down Under is ready for such a model.
In making the remarks to carsguide.com.au, John Signoriello added that the electric Triton, reportedly slated for the next generation model out in 2022, would appeal to buyers seeking a lifestyle pick-up instead of a workhorse that will eventually prove to be more powerful than the current turbodiesel only model.
“Not everyone needs to be off-road in a ute, in fact a lot of them are on bitumen roads, and the technology will get better and better. And eventually, at some point, that technology will do better than what diesel technology does. It’s only a matter of time. I think it would be a good point of difference. Would Australia have its hand up for it? Absolutely,” Signoriello said.
His comment comes after Mitsubishi Head COO, Ashwani Gupta, confirmed back in September that an electrified Triton will become a reality when the newcomer, that will also underpin the next Nissan Navara, debuts.
