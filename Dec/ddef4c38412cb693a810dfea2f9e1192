Tshwane was not yet under administration, but Gauteng’s department of cooperative governance and traditional affairs (Cogta) lawfully applied Section 139 of the constitution to intervene in the city’s chaotic affairs, the MEC said yesterday.
MEC Lebogang Maile set the record straight after Gauteng DA legislature leader Solly Msimanga accused the department and the ANC of trying to loot Tshwane’s finances by placing the city under administration.
According to Msimanga, the MEC incorrectly applied Section 139 in an attempt for the ANC-led provincial government to “hijack” the capital city.
“These failed attempts by MEC Maile are part of a broader plan by the ANC-led Gauteng provincial government to gain control of the city’s fiscus as we move towards the 2021 local government elections. Money meant for service delivery will, no doubt, be diverted to campaigning activities.”
But the city was not placed under administration, Maile said. Instead, the department intervened due to numerous scandals, tender irregularities and service delivery issues.
“There’s no such thing. Tshwane is not under administration, but we took the decision to implement Section 139(1) of the constitution and we will be following the required process. [Msimanga] should be arguing about the merits of our decision and not the technical process.”
Maile announced the decision on Friday, the morning after a chaotic council meeting where mayor Stevens Mokgalapa and speaker Katlego Mathebe were ousted in no-confidence motions, which was temporarily overturned by the high court on Friday too.
Cogta officials, who were present at the sitting, presided over the meeting following a row about Mathebe recusing herself as soon as the meeting commenced.
