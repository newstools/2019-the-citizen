The community of Tshepisong recently protected an officer of the law when a suspect resisted arrest and assaulted him, reports Krugersdorp News.
In a statement sent by the Kagiso Police spokesperson Captain Solomon Sibiya, he explained that resisting arrest and assaulting an officer of the law were serious offences.
“Some members of the community of Tshepisong at least showed some decency and protected our member from a violent suspect, who had already inflicted a wound to his finger,” explained Sibiya.

He said the officer responded to a domestic violence call in Tshepisong Phase 5 on Sunday evening and went to the address to make an arrest. When the man resisted arrest, a struggle ensued and the man bit the officer’s ring finger.
Nearby residents jumped in to assist the officer and help make the arrest.
“The suspect was eventually put inside the police vehicle and later detained at the Kagiso Police Station. The officer was taken to the hospital for treatment,” Sibiya said.
A case of assault on a police officer was opened and the man was formally charged. The man has already appeared in the Kagiso Magistrate’s Court.
