Having unveiled the all-new Quantum in May this year, Toyota has reinstated the 14-seat GL derivative of the previous generation model under the revived the HiAce moniker due to buyer demand.
Joining the taxi focused Ses’Fikile 16-seat model, the GL now serves as the flagship HiAce and while offered with two colour options; Ivory White and Quicksilver Metallic, is powered by a single engine; the stalwart 2.5 D-4D turbodiesel that sends its 75kW/260Nm to the rear wheels via a five-speed manual gearbox.
Like the Ses’Fikile, the GL is built at Toyota’s Prospecton Plant in Durban, but unlike the equivalent Quantum, does not require a code 10 licence as it is classified as a light commercial vehicle.
