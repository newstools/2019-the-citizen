With its initial world debut having been pushed back to 2021, a fresh report has alleged that the next BMW M3 will in fact enter production in November 2020 before the commencing of delivers in 2021.
According to the claim by the BMW Blog, both the M3 and M4 will however be visible in coming months as pre-production test mules are entering the final phases as highlighted two months ago by M boss, Markus Flasch, at the BMW M Festival held at Kyalami.
As is already known, both the M3 and M4 will be powered by the 3.0-litre turbocharged straight-six S58 engine as the X3 and X4 M, with a standard output of 353 kW and 375 kW in Competition branded models. Torque for both engines will be capped at 600 Nm.
In another first, the xDrive all-wheel-drive system from the M5 will also be offered on the standard M3 and the Competition, paired to an eight-speed sport Steptronic gearbox in place of the now departed models’ seven-speed M DCT. A six-speed manual gearbox will continue to be offered, but only with rear-wheel-drive as part of the so-called M3 ‘Pure’.
