The 17-year-old boy from Middelburg went missing while his cousin made it safely back to shore.
Meanwhile, unconfirmed reports indicate that an unidentified body washed up on the beach close to Quinjata on Monday. This has however not yet been connected to Steyn.
In January, four South African holidaymakers drowned at Portuguese Island along the Mozambican coastal line. Lesego Matsepe, Mmatholo Mogafe, David Kaise, and Gregory Mfune travelled to Mozambique to celebrate Mmatholo Mogafe’s birthday.
