Water consumption in Cape Town has decreased considerably in the last week, the City of Cape Town said on Monday.
Dams are down from 78.6% to 77.5%, with water consumption falling to 701 million litres per day for the week of December 16-22. This is down 51 million litres per day, compared to the previous week, the City said in a statement.
It thanked residents who “continue to think water during this recovery period for Cape Town’s dams”.
“The City urges residents to practise water conservation and make saving water a way of life, as this will enable the City to provide safe, reliable, sustainable and affordable water and sanitation services to residents.”
A week before, water consumption had risen to 752 million litres per day for the week of December 9-15, with the City urging residents to remain waterwise, as well as “think, act and respond positively” towards water-saving efforts.
A massive water savings campaign in 2018 – during a prolonged drought, first identified in 2015 – saw severe restrictions introduced which resulted in consumption being limited to 50 litres per person per day.
The City currently has Level 3 water restrictions in effect, with residents and visitors allocated 105 litres of water per person per day.
