Mercedes-AMG has released the first official teaser clip of what is likely to be the electrified production version of the original GT 4-Door concept.
Unveiled at the Geneva Motor Show two years ago, the concept came powered by the familiar 4.0-litre bi-turbo V8 that had been paired to an electric motor for a rumoured total system output of some 600 kW that would see it reach 100 km/h from naught in less than three seconds.
While the 2.37 second clip, which mainly pays homage to AMG’s racing and road car team’s exploits throughout the year, doesn’t reveal much about the GT apart from the obvious wine and instant power surge from the electric motor, Britain’s Autocar claims that the model will become the first modern day AMG to bear the 73 moniker in nearly two decades.
A designation last used on the SL in 2001, the GT 73 will rival the likes of the Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid and the rumoured mild-hybrid Performance version of the Audi RS7 Sportback, with the amount of twist set to be delivered to all four wheels via revised nine-speed MCT transmission.
Based on the publication’s claims, the GT 73 could make its world debut in Geneva in March.
