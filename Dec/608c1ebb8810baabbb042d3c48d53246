The embattled power utility has once again been struggling with capacity despite another unit being commercialised recently at Medupi Power Station.
Eskom announced it had brought its Unit 2 into commercial operation, adding a much-needed 800MW to the national grid, but it has not been enough, as general infrastructure remains in a poor state.
Consumers are advised to check their local schedules to see how they will be affected.
The utility was hit by “unplanned breakdowns” that went beyond the 10,500MW threshold. They apologised to the country and said that if people lowered their demand in a “concerted” way that would also help to minimise strain on the grid.
