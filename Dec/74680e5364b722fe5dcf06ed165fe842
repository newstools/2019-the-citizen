Toyota has ignited speculation that its latest patent filing with the United States Patent and Trademark Office has paved the way for the concept FT-4X becoming a reality.
Unveiled at New York International Auto Show two years ago where it was described as being 75% production, motor1.com reports that the automaker’s filing for the designation 4Active could either represent the final production name of the FJ Cruiser inspired crossover, or possibly even refer to a completely different aspect of it or future models.
What it however known is that Toyota will be producing an all-new crossover from 2021 at its equally fresh Huntsville Plant in Alabama as part of a $1.6-billion (R22.4-billion) joint development exercise with Mazda, which will seemingly be the FT-4X after the cancellation of Corolla production as well as that of an unspecified Mazda SUV.
In concept form, the FT-4X makes use of the same TNGA platform as the Corolla, C-HR and RAV4, but if approved, will slot-in between the latter pair and join the 4Runner, Highlander, Sequoia and Land Cruiser 200 in Toyota’s North American SUV line-up.
Another possible theory is that the 4Active patent could refer to the four-wheel-drive system, which will however come without a low-range transfer case as previewed by the FT-4X. Expect more details and reports on the matter to emerge within the coming weeks and months.
