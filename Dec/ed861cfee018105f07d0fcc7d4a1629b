BMW has officially provided clarity on its i-range by announcing that i3 production will continue until 2024, while that of the i8 will end next year.
According to a report by carscoops.com, Munich will consolidate production of its plug-in hybrid sports car in April next year with a limited run of 200 Ultimate Sophisto Edition models. Bringing total i8 production to 20 000 units since assembly began at the Leipzig plant five years ago, the Ultimate Sophisto will feature a bespoke Sophisto Grey Brilliant Effect paint finish, unique touches inside and out, and the 11.6 kWh lithium-ion battery pack which, when combined with the 1.5-litre turbocharged three-cylinder petrol engine, will result in a combined system output of 275 kW.
Like the standard the i8, the Ultimate Sophisto will be offered in Coupe and Roadster bodystyles with the former boasting an all-electric range of 55 km and the latter 53 km. Top speed is limited to 250 km/h with the hard-top reaching 100 km/h from zero in 4.4 seconds and the Roadster in 4.6 seconds.

“The BMW i8 is a very special automobile, which stands for the driving pleasure from Leipzig in a unique way. We at the plant are all very proud to produce this flagship of the BMW brand in our company,” Leipzig factory manager Hans-Peter Kemser was quoted as saying.
Meanwhile the i3, whose future remained uncertain until being confirmed two months ago as continuing by CEO Oliver Zipse, has been approved once again by an unnamed BMW spokesperson who revealed to electrive.com via the Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper that “we will continue to build the i3 until 2024”.
