A Centurion beauty queen will be heading to Mumbai, India, to represent South Africa in the Miss India Continent competition, Centurion Rekord reports.
This comes after Aneshree Buldeo, 21, was named the winner of the local Miss India SA International competition in Durban.
The competition took place on May 4.
Aneshree will take part in the international leg of the competition in November, in Mumbai, India.
In March, Aneshree and her sister Avathara Buldeo, 19, were crowned queen and first princess at the Lyric Theatre at Gold Reef City.
The sisters, currently residing in The Reeds, grew up in Centurion and attended Hoërskool Uitsig.
Aneshree first became interested in beauty pageants at the age of 12. She is currently in her final year of accounting studies at the University of Johannesburg.
“Entering the Miss India Gauteng has been the biggest pageant so far,” said Aneshree.
“Both my sister and I wanted to enter together because we wanted to inspire the community, especially the youth.”
The two sisters hoped to inspire a movement called “Two sisters, one journey”.
They hope to visit various schools in Centurion and across the country in order to inspire young people to chase their dreams.
The sisters hope to break the stereotype that “women cannot be smart and beautiful”.
