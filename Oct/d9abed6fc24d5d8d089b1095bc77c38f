There are two ways to view this development.
First, perhaps Sanral has accepted defeat on e-tolls and wants to put the expensive electronic infrastructure that powers them to some socially acceptable use.
On the other hand, perhaps Sanral knows something we don’t: that e-tolls won’t be scrapped and that defaulting motorists may be lured into the system through sweeteners, such as the ability to use an e-tag as a form of debit card.
We certainly hope it is the former because, if it is the latter, the e-toll fight will continue.
If it does, and now that Sanral – and the ANC government – have accumulated more billions in debt because motorists won’t pay, they might start using heavy-handed intimidation tactics. But, they should be warned: motorists are ready for a fight.
