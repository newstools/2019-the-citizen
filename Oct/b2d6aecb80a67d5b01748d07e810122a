It hasn’t been a good year for the Proteas. A shock Test series defeat to Sri Lanka on home soil and a lowly seventh place finish at this year’s World Cup in England and Wales will make 2019 a year to forget.
Throw in a fresh 3-0 smack from India in the Test series this month and it is worrying times indeed for SA cricket, as they attempt to pick up the pieces under a new interim team director and fill the void left by the retirement of some of their stalwarts.
Now, the chaos has spread to the boardroom. Cricket South Africa this week suspended three senior staff members – interim director of cricket Corrie van Zyl, chief operating officer Naasei Appiah and commercial manager Clive Eksteen – pending an inquiry into alleged dereliction of duty over the nonpayment of commercial rights fees during last year’s Mzansi Super League.

The Mzansi Super League starts next week and England arrive here in December. The authorities must not only sort out cricket on the field, but also off it. And quickly.
