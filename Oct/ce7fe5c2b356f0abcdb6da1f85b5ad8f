Rassie Erasmus told the media earlier this week that he wasn’t going to bluff anyone ahead of the World Cup final and at least did so with his team selection for Saturday’s climax against England in Yokohama.
The dynamic Cheslin Kolbe is the only change to the match-23 that outlasted Wales last week, following his recovery from an ankle injury that has remained rather pesky.
“Cheslin is fit and he is back in the team,” Erasmus said.
“We were a bit nervous when we lost him for the semi-final, but the nice thing about the squad is that we have a lot of depth. Cheslin is world class and he has shown that whenever he has played for us.”
His return means that the unfortunate S’bu Nkosi is dropped, but definitely not without thanks.
“It’s tough on Sbu to drop out of the 23 altogether but, like the other seven, non-playing squad members – and the two injured players back home (Trevor Nyakane and Jesse Kriel) – he has made vital contributions to our campaign.”
Inspirational skipper Siya Kolisi will notably have the honour of running out for his 50th Test on the grandest stage of them all.
“It’s a great achievement for Siya,” said Erasmus.
“Any Springbok captain carries a heavy load – probably doubly so in Siya’s case – and he has really risen to the occasion over the past two years.
“No one is hiding from the significance that would be attached to him lifting the trophy on behalf of this team and South Africa. But first and foremost on Saturday this is a rugby match that we’re only focused on winning.”
