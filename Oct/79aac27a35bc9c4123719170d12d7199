The chairperson of the commission of inquiry into state capture, Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo, on Monday granted former Port Elizabeth businessman and Armscor CEO Kevin Wakeford leave to give oral evidence at the inquiry and to cross-examine former Bosasa chief operations officer Angelo Agrizzi and the company’s former head of central business, Frans Vorster.
Zondo gave the order that Wakeford’s non-compliance with the time frames provided for by the rules governing the commission’s proceedings in relation to an application to cross-examine a witness was condoned.
Zondo said Wakeford was granted leave to give oral evidence and to cross-examine Agrizzi and Vorster in terms of rule 3.3.6 read along with rules 3.4; 3.5; 3.6; 3.7; and 3.8.
Zondo said at the commencement of proceedings on the day Wakeford is expected to cross-examine these witnesses, he would outline the terms of those proceedings.
Wakeford will cross-examine Agrizzi on Wednesday and Zondo will at the commencement of those proceedings announce the time Wakeford will be granted.
Zondo further said that Wakeford has been granted leave to make written and oral submissions on the commission’s possible findings in relation to him.
Wakeford’s name was mentioned by Agrizzi in the list of individuals who are said to have benefited from the Bosasa Group.
