Amidst a crossword puzzle teaser released last month, Hyundai has quietly announced pricing and spec details for the revived Atos on its website.
Returning to South Africa after a long hiatus, the Atos, which debuted in India last year as the Santro, will, for now, only be available as a single model; the Motion powered by a 1.1-litre petrol engine producing 50kW/99Nm and paired to a five-speed manual gearbox. Claimed fuel consumption is slightly up on the Santro’s 4.9 L/100 km at 5.7 L/100 km, while top speed is rated at 155 km/h and 0-100 km/h in 14.4 seconds.
Measuring 3 610 mm in overall length with a wheelbase of 2 400 mm, height of 1 560 mm and width of 1 645 mm, the Atos’ standard specification list consists of a seven-touch touchscreen infotainment system with Bluetooth, USB and Apple CarPlay, 14-inch steel wheels with plastic covers, a multi-function steering wheel, front electric windows, a four-speaker sound system, dual front airbags and ABS with EBD.
Tipping the scales at 866 kg and offering 235-litres of boot space, the Atos can be had in a choice of six colours; Polar White, Titan Grey, Typhoon Silver, Alpha Blue, Acid Yellow and Fiery Red with a five year/150 000 km warranty, plus an additional two year/50 000 km powertrain warranty being included in the R159 900 asking price.
