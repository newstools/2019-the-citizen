Democratic Alliance (DA) member of the Johannesburg mayoral committee for finance Funzela Ngobeni has reportedly said he was available as a replacement for outgoing mayor Herman Mashaba.
SowetanLive reports that within DA circles Ngobeni has been touted as Mashaba’s possible replacement following the latter’s resignation from the party and as mayor on Monday.
Ngobeni told the publication that he was certainly available for the mayoral office.
It was reported that Ngobeni is the chair of the DA’s regional council and may be considered as Mashaba’s replacement.
The party’s national spokesperson, Solly Malatsi, told the publication that discussions on Mashaba’s replacement have not been held by the DA as yet.
Malatsi was quoted as saying that it would be premature to speculate on Mashaba’s possible successors.
Malatsi announced on Monday following Mashaba’s announcement that he was resigning that the DA federal executive (FedEx) would meet urgently to “assess the impact” of Mashaba’s decision.
The DA FedEx will meet on Wednesday.
Meanwhile, it was reported that DA leader Mmusi Maimane is expected to follow in Mashaba’s steps.
