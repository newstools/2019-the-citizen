Race 2 No 11 Over Count
Cape Town horses tend to flourish in Port Elizabeth and considering Over Count has the right form credentials to win, having registered a third from two starts, she looks a solid BiPot banker.
Best ignore her most recent seventh-place finish, she was appallingly drawn on that occasion. If she brings her debut form to the course, she will most likely make amends for that result.
Bargain Bet
Race 7 No 3 Crome Yellow
This six-time winner simply doesn’t know how to run badly. He has beaten a lot of these rivals and will attempt to maintain his unbeaten record at this venue.
He was on an impressive two-run winning streak prior to finishing third in the Listed Settlers Trophy last time, gallantly running down Belgarion to lose by a length. He has shown a tremendous liking for 2000m and has recorded a victory and two thirds from three starts.
