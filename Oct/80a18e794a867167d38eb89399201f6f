Although it was initially reported that BMW would take the wraps off of the all-new M3 and M4 next year, the M division’s boss has confirmed that both would now only be unveiled in 2021.
Announcing that production will in fact commence in 2020 , Markus Flasch, on the sidelines of this past weekend’s M Festival at Kyalami, told Australia’s motoring.com.au that both are currently in the pre-production phase as evident by recent spy images.
“The [M3] pictures didn’t leak on purpose. I mean, the car’s ready. It’s a pre-production car that leaked,” Flasch said of the images showing the rear facia of a red M3 and the alleged front of the M4 mirrored on the controversial Concept 4 that premiered in Frankfurt last month.
Reaffirming comments made to Britain’s Car Magazine in August, Flasch said that both the M3 and M4 will be offered with rear-and-four-wheel-drive, as well as a manual or automatic gearbox, with power set to come from the all-new S58 3.0-litre turbocharged straight-six engine that debuted in the X3 and X4 M.
While the engine will produce 353 kW in the ‘standard’ M3/M4 and 375 kW in the Competition derivatives with torque capped at 600 Nm, a so-called ‘Pure’ version will also be offered equipped with the former engine output and with drive going to the rear wheels via the manual gearbox only.
Expect more details to be revealed in the coming months.
