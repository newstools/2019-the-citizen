England coach Eddie Jones was jubilant on Saturday after they beat Argentina to become the first team to reach the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals — with a game to spare.
Four years after they embarrassingly failed to escape the group stage on home soil, England swamped 14-man Argentina 39-10 for their third straight one-sided win in Pool C.
“We’re exactly where we wanted to be — we’re 15 points after three games, we’re playing in front of a fantastic crowd at Tokyo Stadium and it’s another great day for the World Cup,” beamed Jones.
Top-rated wing Jack Nowell celebrated his return from injury with a late try, while Jonny May, Elliot Daly, Ben Youngs, George Ford and Luke Cowan-Dickie also crossed the whitewash.
It wasn’t all good news for England, as talismanic number eight Billy Vunipola was withdrawn at half-time, apparently in some discomfort.
But Jones laughed off Vunipola’s withdrawal. “I think he had a bit too much Kobe beef, mate,” said the Aussie.
Owen Farrell, the victim of Tomas Lavanini’s head-high tackle that earned the Argentinian a red card, uncharacteristically missed all four of his place kicks in the first half — before recovering to land four from four in the second period.
“I fixed it up a little bit after half-time but I’ll do some work this week,” shrugged the England captain.
