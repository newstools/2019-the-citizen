Club rugby in the Western Cape has once again been dogged by poor spectator behaviour against a referee.
A thrilling match between Robertson Town and Roses United – decided by a last-gasp try and conversion – was soured by verbal and alleged physical attacks on Curtley Booysen, who officiated proceedings.
According to Die Son, the 23-year-old is regarded as one of the more promising referees in the region and had to be escorted to a car afterwards by Lionel Hendricks, Robertson’s president, and several others as angry supporters swarmed around him.

Former international referee, Shaun Veldsman, who was at the game, told the publication that Booysen was “in tears” at the conclusion of the game.
“I take my hat off to Lionel and the other guys. They truly did their best to protect Curtley from swarm of barbaric supporters,” he said.
“He was humiliated by a bunch of drunk armchair refs.”
The group of fans in question were apparently unhappy with some of Booysen’s decisions.
Veldsman also said that he took Booysen from Hendricks and put him in his car to drive him to safety, a deed of goodwill that led to one of his windscreens being cracked.
“He’s (Booysen) been going through a lot recently. His father passed away and now he has to deal with this hooliganism.”
Western Province recently had to give its referees’ association better guarantees of safety after its members embarked on a strike, protesting “abuse and poor remuneration”.
