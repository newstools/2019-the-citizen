Best Bet
Race 7 No 5 Hildegarde
Considering Hildegarde was returning from a layoff of more than four months recently, she did exceptionally well to finish second behind Celestial Storm over today’s course and distance – beaten a rapidly diminishing 0.40 lengths.
This Adam Marcus-trained dual winner is yet to miss the first three placings over this distance and now that she has the benefit of fitness in her favour, she should prove extremely hard to peg back.
Bargain Bet
Race 1 No 9 Duchess Of State
Jockey Callan Murray is likely to boost his already impressive 22.02% win-strike rate when Duchess Of State returns from a 60-day stint off the racetrack today.
She is clearly no slouch having finished second in both career starts.
Now knowing exactly what is expected of her at the course, this three-year-old filly should improve more than the half-a-length margin she was beaten by last time out. She jumps from the best draw of all and shoulders 2kg less than her main danger Over The Way at 58kg.
