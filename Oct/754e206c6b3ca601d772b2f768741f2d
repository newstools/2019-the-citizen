Race 3 No 3 Freedom Of Speech
This speedy son of Pitchfork sparked tremendous improvement on debut sixth when gallantly setting the fractions under Morne Winnaar and being unluckily nabbed on the line by Camp David to finish third, beaten no more than 0.15 lengths.
This gelding faces a weak field today. His only dangers appear to be the two newcomers – Elusive Tango and Go Man Go – so it is advised you keep an eye on the betting for further guidance. If they aren’t too special, Freedom Of Speech will be very hard to peg back.

Race 2 No 3 Matchless Captain
Although this Brett Crawford-trained gelding is yet to win or run a place after six attempts, he has been much-improved when finishing fifth in last two appearances. Matchless Captain doesn’t meet the strongest of fields today and on this evidence, should finish in the shake-up.
