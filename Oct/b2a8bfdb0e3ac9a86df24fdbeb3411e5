Yet, here we are. The Boks, who have gathered momentum after tripping up against the All Blacks in their opener, face Japan, the unpredictable hosts that topped their pool with an unbeaten run of four matches that saw them surprise Ireland, Scotland and Samoa.
The Springboks, in their seventh World Cup, have always reached the quarterfinals – going on to win the Webb Ellis Cup twice, in 1995 and 2007. On the flip-side, Japan are in uncharted territory, having never reached the knockout stages before this tournament.
Many pundits are writing up the encounter as the speed of Japan’s backs against the sheer strength of South Africa’s forwards. On paper, the Springboks are expected to win this one, but they will underestimate the hosts at their peril.
Japan’s triumph over the Springboks at the 2015 World Cup will probably ensure Rassie Erasmus and company don’t underestimate their foes. Should they do so, Japan won’t need a second invitation to pounce.
The Springboks have the perfect chance to stake their claim as serious title contenders with a commanding performance. Nothing less will do.
