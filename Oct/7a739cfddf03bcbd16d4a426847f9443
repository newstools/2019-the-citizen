Footage of what is described as a four-metre-long python being removed from the engine of a truck has surfaced, showing a few men shying away from assisting those removing the snake.
While a few brave souls battle to free the snake, others appear to be fine just watching the python being pulled out of the truck’s engine.
It is unclear how the driver noticed the snake, but it seems at some point someone reported its presence and alerted authorities, who came to remove it.
The footage even shows one of the men dragging the snake from the engine, in a state of shock over the length of the reptile.
