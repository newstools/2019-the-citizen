Best Bet
Race 3 No 4 Wildly In Love
Wildly In Love does exceptionally well on the Turf and has bagged two victories and a close-up third from last three on this surface. She showed tremendous courage when gutsily fighting Queen Of Alamo all the way to the finish line and winning by a nose over 1000m last time out.
That performance strongly suggests she will have no trouble outclassing this field. 
Bargain Bet
Race 6 No 7 Mighty Smart
Although Mighty Smart has become rather costly to follow, he has been the unluckiest of runner-ups in two of last four appearances. There was a lot to like about his most recent performance when beaten two lengths into second by Self-Mastery over 1900m at this venue.
This striking grey son of Archipenko should relish the drop back in trip and considering he has cracked a good draw at No 3 today, he looks great value for money.
