Race 3 No 2 In The Dance 
This smashing daughter of Gimmethegreenlight kicked off her career by winning two consecutive races and has finished second in two consecutive efforts since.
In The Dance proved she is an above-average thoroughbred when gutsily running down Oh Susanna – a multiple Grade 1 winner – in the Grade 2 Tibouchina Stakes to finish second, beaten a diminishing 0.25 lengths.
This four-year-old has won following a lengthy layoff before, so the 124-day rest shouldn’t raise too many red flags today. She is the best handicapped runner in the race and jumps from a No 2 draw.
On these terms, she will be hard to peg back.

Race 5 No 4 Slay The Dragon
When not winning races, Slay The Dragon consistently runs in the minor money placings.
In fact, he has finished close-up second in last two starts and has only missed the first three twice in last ten starts – impressive statistics.
The manner in which he finished off his last race, when beaten a nose by Jagesa Jagesa, strongly suggests he is begging for the extra 2400m of today’s event. In-form Raymond Danielson retains the ride and will benefit immensely from No 2 draw.
