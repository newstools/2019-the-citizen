However, its latest leading spot is not exactly an accolade which brings honour to the province.
Municipal IQ, an organisation specialising in “local government data and intelligence collection”, says in its latest Municipal Hotspots Monitor that Gauteng has the highest number of service delivery protests – about 24% of the national total. KwaZulu-Natal is not far behind at 21%.
The organisation’s figures have led it to warn that there may be more service delivery protests ahead, because the total nationwide so far this year is already at 199, compared with 237 for the whole of last year.
There is also a sobering picture painted of how these protests have been escalating. It is hard to believe that the first such protests were logged in 2004.
This year’s protests alone account for 11% of all those since then.
Protesters are raising issues that are the responsibility – or the perceived responsibility – of local government, the organisation said.
The unrest is a disturbing mirror for our society and a clear indication that government is failing to bring about the “better life for all” the ANC promised.
