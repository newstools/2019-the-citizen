Opel has shed more light on its growing commercial vehicle division by confirming that the Vivaro and its people carrying sibling, the Zafira Life, will be powered by a 2.0-litre turbodiesel engine when both touchdown next year.
While the local importer and distributor for the French owned German marque, Unitrans Motors, didn’t divulge any further details but that both will become available in the first quarter of 2020, the so-called third generation oil-burner will be sourced from parent company, PSA, and according to Opel, has been chosen for its “lower fuel consumption”, “low-speed torque” and “lower running costs”.

In Europe, the 2.0-litre, which is badged under the BlueHDI moniker in the Citroën Dispatch/Spacetourer and the Peugeot Expert/Traveller and D-4D in the Toyota ProAce and ProAce Verso, is offered in three outputs; 90kW/340Nm, 110kW/370Nm and 130kW/400Nm with the former pair being paired to a six-speed manual gearbox and the latter to an eight-speed automatic only. A Dangel developed four-wheel-drive system is available on the Old Continent, but expect local derivatives to remain front-wheel-driven.
Expect complete details to be announced closer to the Vivaro and Zafira Life’s launch dates.
