It’s clear as daylight that the relationship between DA leader Mmusi Maimane and the DA’s new federal council chairperson Helen Zille, although with a strained history, remains a cordial one. One could not help but notice the split-second reaction Maimane gave to Zille’s “I will stay in my lane” comment.
Zille, at the Sunday media briefing, emphasised that she respected and supported Maimane, adding that she would do her best to ensure the leadership was successful and would take the party to new heights.
Although Zille, who has now been put in charge of the DA’s administration and systems management, said she would play more of a backround role in the party and not be it’s leader, this did not stop Maimane’s almost smile seconds after she made the “stay in my lane” statement.
The footage shows Maimane sitting next to Zille at the briefing on Sunday, moments after Maimane welcomed and outlined her new role within the party. It was when Zille spoke and mentioned that she would operate in the background that a smirk from Maimane cracked through, which he quickly dowsed down with water.


The timing of the smile sparked conversation on social media.






Zille said she would only participate only where it was appropriate for her to do so, and added that she respected the DA’s leadership.
“People are worried that I won’t stay in my lane. The problem is many people have only seen me in a leadership position. But I have very often played behind-the-scenes roles.
“But I can manage something and I can clean the toilets,” TimesLive reported.
Although Maimane said Zille’s appointment would bring new energy and vigour, his body language in the video also had a few on social media questioning his poker face.
