There were no results in this week’s fixtures, suggesting more demure conditions.
However, that means players need to do their utmost to manufacture results … and that’s not necessarily a bad thing.
Here’s what we learned.
Boucher’s change of direction paying dividends

For all his success as Titans coach to date, Mark Boucher – understandably – relied heavily on the Northerns players within his ranks initially.
As a rookie, one tends to stick to home comforts.
Yet following a mediocre campaign last season, the Proteas legend realised he needed to trust regional partner Easterns more if the franchise was going to cope with all its Protea-related absences.
It’s working a treat.
Captain Grant Thomson, an Easterns stalwart, has proven an astute leader and played a major role in a gritty contest with the Warriors in Port Elizabeth.
But he’s not the only one.
Wesley Marshall built on an impressive first franchise century last week with a fluent 66, while Matthew Arnold is an experienced figure in the attack.
It’s a good mix, particularly with promising all-rounder Dayaan Galiem finding his feet too.
Warriors 364/9 dec (Yaseen Vallie 137, Rudi Second 81, Eddie Moore 55, Dayaan Galiem 4/83) and 260 (Matthew Breetzke 80, Eddie Moore 55, Jon-Jon Smuts 45, Tabraiz Shamsi 5/66, Neil Brand 3/59) drew with Titans 343 (Grant Thomson 101, Wesley Marshall 66, Chris Morris 46, Jon-Jon Smuts 4/66, Andrew Birch 3/71) and 104/3 (Grant Thomson 39*)
Dolphins finding the going rather tough

They’ve hardly been awful, but Imraan Khan’s Dolphins certainly suggest they might have some depth issues in 2019/20.
Rooted to the bottom of the log, they’re particularly struggling to bowl teams out without suffering a fair amount of damage.
Last week in Bloemfontein, they conceded over 500 and come within nine runs of doing so in Pietermaritzburg again.
Grant Roelofsen is gradually establishing himself as a franchise cricketer and home-grown player, but the attack seems lack oomph, lacking an out-and-out strike bowler.
It will certainly help if Andile Phehlukwayo finds some consistency.
But the sight of 19-year-old Thando Ntini, son of Makhaya, making a decent debut for the Cobras seemed to put things into perspective: this might not be an easy season for the men from KwaZulu-Natal.
Dolphins 325/9 dec (Grant Roelofsen 133, Andile Phehlukwayo 67, Marques Ackerman 35, Dane Paterson 3/78) and 198/6 (Cody Chetty 69*, Rob Frylinck 44*, Thando Ntini 2/45) drew with Cape Cobras 491 (Matthew Kleinveldt 175, Janneman Malan 118, Kyle Verreynne 78, Smangaliso Nhlebela 4/109, Prenelan Subrayen 4/132)
National understudies keep the pressure on

The Proteas’ batting woes in India makes it increasingly likely that Rassie van der Dussen, with such an outstanding start to his international career, will get a look-in at Test level soon.
And he did those chances no harm with a fluent 75 in the second innings in Kimberley.
Yet the real statement was made by Reeza Hendricks, who, finally at 30, made a proper big score in four-day cricket.
Known as a one-day specialist, the silky stroke-maker strode to a serene, unbeaten 168.
It’s debatable whether that suddenly puts him in the picture for Test cricket, but the timing is certainly appropriate.
Highveld Lions 468/4 dec (Reeza Hendricks 168*, Nicky van den Bergh 116*, Joshua Richards 80, Dominic Hendricks 76, Gerald Coetzee 2/57) and 178/5 dec (Rassie van der Dussen 75, Dominic Hendricks 63) drew with Knights 325 (Raynard van Tonder 81, Gerald Coetzee 48*, Pite van Biljon 48, Malusi Siboto 3/66, Migael Pretorius 3/66) and 62/0 (Raynard van Tonder 35*)
