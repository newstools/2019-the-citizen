With the covers having come off of the 992 generation Porsche 911 at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November last year and off the cabriolet in January, the iconic Stuttgart marque has added to a manual gearbox to the range as a no-cost option.
Available on the Carrera S and Carrera 4S with or without the hard-top roof, the seven-speed manual comes as standard with the Sport Chrono Package which includes a rev-matching function, a sport mode for the Porsche Stability Management system, a mechanical limited-slip differential in place of the electronic unit on models equipped with the eight-speed PDK ‘box, Porsche Torque Vectoring, Dynamic Drivetrain mounts and four driving modes; Normal, Sport, Sport Plus and Individual.
No changes to the powertrain has however been made with the 3.0-litre turbocharged flat-six continuing to produce 331kW/530Nm, though with the manual ‘box in place, the 0-100 km/h sprint time for the S falls from 3.7 seconds to four seconds while the 4S will dispatch the benchmark distance in 3.9 seconds. Top speed for both is rated at “over 305 km/h”.
As mentioned, the ‘box will retail for the same price as the PDK, which means that pricing, once officially confirmed by Porsche South Africa, will kick-off at R1 708 000 for the S Coupe and at R1 797 000 for the 4S with the cabriolet set to carry respective sticker prices of R1 874 000 and R1 964 000.
