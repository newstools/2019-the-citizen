With a line-up of 31 models, Ford has given the mid-range XLS derivative of the Ranger more sparkle with the fitment of a chrome styling package.
Available on not only the double cab but also single-and-super cab models, the chrome pack, worth R20 000, sees the matt grey grille replaced by a twin-horizontal bar chrome nose, while the mirror caps, door handles, tailgate handle and integrated rear step are also chromed. Also standard is a chrome sports bar and six-spoke 17-inch alloy wheels, although the standard 16-inch wheels are retainable at no additional cost.
Aside from the chrome pack, the XLS’ equipment list remains unchanged as does the drivetrain with the 118kW/385Nm 2.2 TDCi and 147kW/470Nm 3.2 TDCI motors continuing to be paired to either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic gearbox. As ever, buyers have the choice of two-or-four-wheel-drive with Hill Descent Control being standard on the latter.
Like the rest of the range, the XLS comes standard with a four year/120 000 km warranty and service plan.
