Nafcoc acting President Gilbert Mosena said early financial literacy for children was important and would boost the economy.
He said their programme was designed to instill an entrepreneurial mind-set in children.
“Prioritisation of children to understand business and be business minded would see the country’s economy boosted.
“The country’s inherited education from the apartheid government does not equip learners with enough entrepreneurship skills.
“The study of economics is foreign to them and that needs to be addressed,’’ said Mosena.
He said many children grew up with the employee mind-set and not entrepreneurship, which had led to slow growth in the economy.
