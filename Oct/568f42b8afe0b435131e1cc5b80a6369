The man allegedly raped the girls aged between six and 11-years-old in the Maqhashu administrative area, police spokesperson Captain Namhla Mdleleni said.
The suspect was wanted for an incident that happened on October 15.
He had allegedly attacked the victims while they were on their way to school.
