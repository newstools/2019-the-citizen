Aiden Markram has “taken full responsibility” for bizarrely breaking his wrist, ruling him out of the final Test against India starting in Ranchi on Saturday.
The embattled Proteas opener, who’s only scored 43 runs in four innings on the tour, “in a moment of frustration with his own performance, he lashed out at a solid object, resulting in his injury”, Cricket South Africa said in a statement.
That moment of madness has resulted in him fracturing wrist bones, necessitating a visit with a specialist in Cape Town.
Surgery could see him being in a race against time to be fit for the series against England, which starts in Centurion on Boxing Day.
Markram said his biggest regret was letting his teammates down.
“It’s sad to be going home on this note and I completely understand what I’ve done wrong and take full accountability for it. It’s unacceptable in a Proteas environment and to let the team down is what hurts me the most. I’ve learned a lot from this and the other players I’m sure, have learned from it as well,” he said.
“We understand in sport that emotions run high and sometimes the frustration gets the better of you as it did for me, but like I said, it’s no excuse. I’ve taken full responsibility for it, I have apologised to the team and hopefully I can make it up to them and the people of South Africa soon.”
There had been talk anyway that Markram should be left out of the team for the final game given his poor form.
South Africa haven’t called up a replacement, meaning either Zubayr Hamza or Heinrich Klaasen will come in, though the most likely scenario is Theunis de Bruyn moving up from No 3 to open the batting.
Earlier this week, Aussie all-rounder Mitchell Marsh too broke his right hand after punching the dressing room wall in a first-class fixture.
