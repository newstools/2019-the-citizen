The Kyalami Grand Prix circuit has played host to some of the biggest motorsport events in the world since opening in 1961, with countless records having been set and broken here over the last 58 years.
And in what was probably the most bizarre but still significant event, the 4.52km ribbon that is South Africa’s best known motorsport track hosted a new Guinness World Record attempt on October 8 for the most hearses present in procession at the same time.
The highlight of the first-ever funeralcar.co.za exhibition saw hearses from across the province line up to better the record of 107 in the Netherlands in 2012 of the most hearses present in procession at the same time.
While the final number is yet to be officially verified by Guinness, an estimated 110 funeral cars showed up for the one lap procession of a minimum distance of 3.2km, some with (empty) coffins in the back and others sporting elaborate designs such as gullwing doors in limousine body configurations.
“Funeral homes and the drivers of hearses play an essential role. The attempt to set a new world record was an amazing opportunity to connect the industry and show a bit of appreciation for their efforts,” funeralcars.co.za CEO Rachel Stead said.
Funeralcar. co.za’s exhibition not only showcased various aspects of the funeral industry, such as equipment and hearses, but allowed interested parties to get a closer look at the business and interact with the manufacturers and converters present.
“The exhibition was also a chance for the various vehicle manufacturers to connect with the owners and managers of funeral homes.
“We have been working to bridge the gap that traditionally existed between the two,” Stead added.
“An expo of this magnitude was another step in the right direction. Once the record is verified, all that remains is to make sure it remains ours.”
