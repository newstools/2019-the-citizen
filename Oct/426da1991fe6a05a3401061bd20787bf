The iconic Hummer brand is reportedly set to be revived by parent company General Motors (GM) after being dissolved in 2010, but as a dedicated electric marque.
According to Reuters, the expected revival of Hummer will coincide with GM’s $3-billion (R44.2-billion) investment into its Detroit-Hamtramck plant as part of the BT1 project, which forms part of a bigger $7.7-billion (R113.6-billion) investment across all of its respective plants over the next four years.
Based on the publication’s claims, BT1 will commence in 2021 with the introduction of a pick-up, followed by a performance version in 2022 and an SUV in 2023 with a planned electric GMC pick-up and Cadillac SUV also out in the same year.
“Putting a Hummer badge on anything is a great idea for General Motors because half the marketing is already paid for. Making it environmentally friendly is just icing on the cake,” Vice-President of Global Vehicle Forecasting for automotive firm, Auto Forecast Solutions, Sam Fiorani said.
At present, the plant, which will be supplemented by an all-new battery manufacturing facility near the Lordstown, Ohio Assembly Plant that closed in March this year, will have a projected capacity of producing 80 000 vehicles a year, a claim touted by Fiorani as being realistic.
GM has however declined to comment on the claims with spokeswoman, Jordana Strosberg, merely telling Reuters that, “We have announced that a pickup truck will be part of our future portfolio, but have no additional information to provide”.
