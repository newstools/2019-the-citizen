Best Bet
Race 6 No 6 Arnica Montana
Mike de Kock-trained Arnica Montana looks a decent sort in the making having recorded two seconds and a third.
The only thing he has done wrong on all three occasions is not stick his nose down when it mattered most. De Kock sent this three-year-old to KwaZulu-Natal last time out, where he failed to justify 2-10 hotpot favouritism.
He teams up with work rider Chamu Mabaya today. Not only is he well drawn at No 6, he is also weighted to win – shouldering 58kg. Arnica Montana by far has the best form in the field and should be extremely hard to oppose.
Bargain Bet
Race 7 No 9 Al Ragnar 
Al Ragnar proved his debut seventh was all wrong when – from the worst draw of all – he produced a smashing turn of foot under jockey Muzi Yeni in his follow-up, finishing second behind Gimme The Fire, beaten no more than a nose.
Perhaps 1600m was a touch too short for him on debut, explaining why Mike de Kock has decided to race him over 2400m today.
