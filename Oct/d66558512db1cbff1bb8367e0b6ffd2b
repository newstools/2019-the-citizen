Once the Mercedes-Benz had come to a halt, the three assailants robbed the driver of his Rolex watch.
The suspects then tried to hijack a BMW, but the driver of the vehicle wouldn’t give up the car without a fight.
A shootout between the driver and the suspects ensued, forcing the three men to flee the scene.
“The suspects managed to hijack a VW Polo, which was later found abandoned a few kilometres from the scene,” Makhubele said.
There were no injuries or fatalities.
“We are calling on anyone with information to come forward,” Makhubele urged.
Sandton Police corporate communications officer Captain Granville Meyer said, “I can confirm that the incident happened and three robbery cases were opened at our station.” Meyer also revealed that the car hijacked was recovered in Kramerville.
“No arrests have been made and the case is under investigation,” he said.
