Best Bet
Race 8 No 5 Takatul
Four-time winner Takatul has been forced to settle for the runner-up position in last two performances when backed up to favourite. Courtesy of a plum No 2 draw and light weight of 55kg, this Stephanie Miller-trained four-year-old is more likely to repay all those who remain faithful with a decent paycheck today.
He loves this this 1400m trip and has already won twice over it this season.
Bargain Bet
Race 7 No 6 Regent Seven
Although Regent Seven’s previous form is sketchy, he has finished close-up second in last two efforts – suggesting he’s finally turned the corner. With a bit more improvement, he could record a second career win and first for his new yard.
Both those last two efforts were over 1400m and he finished them off like he is begging for the extra ground. He shoulders 2.5kg less than main danger In Flitemode at 56.5kg and is well drawn at No 4, so will be very hard to peg back.
