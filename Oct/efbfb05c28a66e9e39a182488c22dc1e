The body of an AfriCaren Inn guest was found in the swimming pool of the guest house on Monday morning.
The manager of the guesthouse, who wished to remain anonymous, told Kempton Express on Monday that the deceased’s friends said he left the room where they were socialising.
They noticed he was missing when they woke up the next morning. They didn’t think much of him leaving, since they thought he might’ve returned to his room for the night.
“His friends came to us and asked whether we had seen him. We told them to look at the swimming pool.”
According to the manager, the swimming pool has designated times during which it can be accessed, and closes at 6pm.
According to Kempton Park SAPS spokesperson Sgt Dipuo Ditshego, the man was last seen on Sunday.
She also said the body had been discovered by his friends.
