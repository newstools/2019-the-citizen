Greyville Turf track Sunday (12-10-19) Best Bet Race 6 No 1 Jack’s Bird Straight out the maidens, Michael Roberts-trained Jack’s Bird, was thrown in the deep end – Grade 1 Thekwini Stakes – and considering she was cut for running room in the early stages, she did exceptionally well to finish 3.35 length behind highly rated Gabor. She goes up against a weaker field today, so looks a solid Pick 6 banker. The only concern is the 78-day layoff she returns from. Jack’s Bird is weighted to win and jumps from a decent No 4 draw.

Bargain Bet
Race 8 No 7 Mutawaary
Mutawaary is the model of consistency and has recording a second and three thirds from last four performances.
There was a lot to like about his most recent offering when producing a late assault on Coldhardcash to finish second, beaten no more than 1.60 lengths. He is a dual winner at this racecourse and has only missed the first three in two of six starts.
He also shoulders an advantageous 1.5kg less than his main danger Blaze Of Silk at 59kg, so should have no trouble outrunning that rival.
