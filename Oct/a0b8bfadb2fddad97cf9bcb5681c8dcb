Schalk Brits will forever be remembered as one of the most affable and popular players in world rugby.

Watch here as he engages in a hilarious jersey exchange with opposite number Andrew Qauttrin.




He also bowed to a ball carrier before a set-piece and had a poignant moment with the crowd when he was replaced.




It all just added to the Brits legend.
