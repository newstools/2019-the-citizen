The trial of Miguel Louw continues in the Durban High Court on Tuesday following a postponement on Monday.
Mohamed Vahed Ebrahim, 43,  is accused of luring Louw with fast food before kidnapping and allegedly killing him.
He has pleaded not guilty to all charges of murder, theft, and kidnapping.
Louw did not return home from school and was last seen on July 17, 2018. It was his mother who reported him missing, which led to a manhunt by police.
A two-page indictment by the state alleges that Ebrahim committed the crime in 2018 following an argument with the mother. It is believed that Ebrahim, who frequently visited the family, had a romantic relationship with Louw’s mother and a fallout with her, and that this led to his alleged revenge on her son.
Louw’s body was found in a bush in Longbury Drive, Phoenix.
The trial continues on Tuesday after state prosecutor Kelvin Singh asked for more time to resolve preliminary matters with the defence on Monday.
