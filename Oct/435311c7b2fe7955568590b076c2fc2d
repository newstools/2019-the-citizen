Motorists are advised to be cautious on the road due to the protest action on Malibongwe Drive, the N14 intersection, and on the R114.

​The Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) spokesperson, Wayne Minnaar, told Fourways Review earlier that officers being sent to maintain the situation. “The protest action is pretty bad and it is causing traffic through Lanseria,” he said.
“We warn motorists to be cautious.”


Protesters were reportedly demonstrating due to illegal electricity connections being removed at Thabo Mbeki informal settlement, Jacaranda FM reports.
According to EWN, police are currently monitoring the area.
The road motorists use to travel to Lanseria Airport was barricaded with stones and tyres were burnt. Minnaar said this was the only route able to access the area.
Although debris from Monday morning’s protest was cleared by police, protesters reportedly returned to the area to pick up where they left off.
