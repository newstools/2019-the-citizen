With the recent announcement that Mercedes-AMG’s new 2.0-litre M139 four-cylinder engine would not be limited to its smaller models only, a new report from the United Kingdom has claimed that the blown four-pot will replace the 4.0-litre bi-turbo V8 in the all-new C63 due out in 2022.
At the Frankfurt Motor Show last month, AMG boss Tobias Moers told paultan.org that the engine in question, which debuted in the A45/CLA45, will not only be used for four-wheel-drive models, but also derivatives “which are no necessarily east-west applications”, meaning a possible rollout on rear-wheel-drive models as well.
Based on the latest claims by Britain’s Autocar, the M139 will not only replace the long serving twin-blown bent-eight, but receive the 48-volt mild-hybrid EQ Boost system used in 53 models for a rumoured output of more than 373 kW.
Effectively a configuration that was rumoured to be heading for the A45 S, the inclusion of the mild-hybrid 2.0-litre will allegedly result in the C63 being more powerful than the outgoing V8 model, while also being noticeably lighter in spite of the added electrical system.
What’s more, the publication’s claims stands in accordance with a report earlier this month by Australia’s motoring.com.au that the next C63 will join the model on which it is based, the W206 C-Class, in being offered solely with a hybrid powertrain.
In addition, drive will be routed to all four wheels for the first time, a claim made by Britain’s Top Gear Magazine three months, with the only similarity set to be carried over from the current W205 being the choice of bodystyles, namely a sedan, coupe, estate and cabriolet.
Expect more details to be divulged in the coming weeks and months.
