Race 1 No 2 Varnica
Varnica has run a place in two of three starts, including when a game third over today distance most recently. She is the joint best-weighted runner alongside Sapphire Rock and gets the services of jockey Muzi Yeni, who is talented enough to get this three-year-old to overcome the wide No 11 draw.

On those results, one can’t help but she is more than ready to shed her maiden tag.
