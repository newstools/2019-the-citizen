Air Chefs, a catering subsidiary of South African Airways (SAA), has successfully interdicted industrial action by the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa).
Numsa had issued a notice to strike claiming an anniversary bonus payment had been amended unilaterally by Air Chefs.
“The bonus payment is regulated by the Catering and Allied Bargaining Council Collective agreement and is therefore not a matter of mutual interest that Numsa may strike over. Air Chefs’ position is that it is not in breach of the collective agreement relating to bonus payments but is in strict compliance thereto. Any dispute Numsa may have on this matter must be adjudicated at the Bargaining Council through conciliation and arbitration,” said SAA in a statement.
The company approached the labour court bringing an application to interdict or stop the industrial action. It was granted on Monday.
“This means, should any members of Numsa at Air Chefs continue with industrial action, before this date, this will be deemed an unprotected strike as it is not in compliance with the strike provisions according to the Labour Relations Act.
“In addition to the interdict, Air Chefs management has taken steps to activate contingency plans to ensure minimal or no impact on all operations and to Air Chefs customers including the airlines it serves, should an unprotected industrial action take place,” SAA further said.
There were no operational disruptions on Monday.
