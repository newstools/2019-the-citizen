There is nothing resembling the mythical ‘racing certainty’ on the Greyville turf today, but one who does make  a strong appeal is Ode in Race 2.
This Johan Janse van Vuuren- trained Oratorio filly faced males here a week ago and ran on late from a wide draw to only go down 0.50 lengths over the minimum trip. This full sister to useful Euphoric should relish going 1200m and now jumps from an inside gate against females, so there’s lots to like about her chances.
She makes a solid first choice, but it’s not the weakest maiden plate, and both Kildonan Bay and Gauteng raider Cut Loose can be expected to put up resistance.
Similarly, in Race 7 Good Rhythm is a standout bet, but with reservations. This Alastair Gordon-trained gelding ran on really strongly last time over an inadequate 1000m. He now has his third run after a rest over 1400m, the trip which has seen him chalk up both of his wins.
Sherman Brown’s mount looks the one to beat, but there is a wild card in Bre Crawford’s G G’s Dynasty who returns from a four-month break but has won two races from three starts since arriving in KZN. Gelded since finishing second to the useful Cat Daddy, he seems certain to challenge strongly if racing fit.
In Race 1 Ancient State stands out in a weakish field of maidens, but this time the draw is the bugbear. He has pulled the one from outside gate, but has plenty of gate speed, and should be able to overcome that handicap in such limited company.
