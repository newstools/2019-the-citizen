Many people knew, before the team went to India, that beating the world’s best on home ground was never going to be easy.
It would be a challenge, so the perceived wisdom went, to deal with the Indian spinners on wickets tailor-made to suit them.
And that was before the genius of Virat Kohli as batsman and inspirational leader was factored in.
