Following her 0.50-length third place behind Querari Ferrari last week, Gary Alexander-trained Thandekhile has moved into No 17 spot on the log for the R1-million Emperors Palace Ready To Run Cup (Non-Black Type) over 1400m on Saturday 2 November.
Two improvers on the log are Follow My Path (No 14 from 19) and Hurricane Harry, from No 13 to No 10. 
Sean Tarry-trained Spiritofthegroove retains her position at the top of the log.
The field size will be limited to 16 runners plus two reserve runners. The final field will be determined by a panel appointed by the racing operator.
All horses will carry 60kg but there will be a northern hemisphere allowance as well as a sex allowance of 2.5kg.
Entries close at 11am on Monday 21 October, supplementary entries close at 9am on Monday 28 October with declarations having to be in by 11am on Tuesday 29 October.
