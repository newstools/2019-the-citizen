The initiative is aimed at increasing the metro’s tax and revenue base, expanding food export and attracting new investments into the metro.
It would also enhance the quality of livelihoods and increase the number of job opportunities in the region.
In a statement released by metro spokesperson Nhlanhla Cebekhulu, it explains that the programme will generate about R200 million in revenue for the metro through medium-term leases, in addition to other economic benefits.
“The City’s agriculture development and support programme, of which the rapid land release is part of, covers five key elements that will transform and grow the agriculture and agro-processing sector in Ekurhuleni.
“Farmers will be assisted with access to council-owned land, technical support, skills development, access to funding and access to markets and off-take agreements,” he explains.
The metro is in the process of finalising economic partnership agreements with private sector companies, government agencies, development financial institutions, industry bodies, farmers’ associations, research institutions and training organisations.
“About R14 million has already been budgeted in the current financial year for services of researchers and economists who will provide support to the programme,” said Cebekhulu.
