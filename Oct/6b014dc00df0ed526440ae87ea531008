Best Bet
Race 3 No 8 Duke Of York
Trainer Johan Janse van Vuuren is in exceptional form at the moment and recently saddled his 300th winner.
He should add on to that figure when Duke Of York makes his debut on the synthetic surface. Although still a maiden, this three-year-old is yet to miss the first three placings and there was a lot to like about his most recent appearance when beaten 4.20 lengths into fourth by Orchid Street.
Duke Of York has been backed up to 11-10 favourite in this contest and considering he is smartly drawn at No 4, a loss is highly unlikely.
Bargain Bet
Race 1 No 2 Rocket Rhumba 
At 11-2 the Doug Campbell-trained Rocket Rhumba looks great value for money when he competes on the Polytrack for the first.
Despite returning from a five-month layoff today, he produced a career best when gallantly running down Africadia over today’s distance, losing by a rapidly diminishing 0.10 lengths.
He tops the best-weighted column and will strip fitter and stronger horse. On this evidence, he is most likely going to improve more than the short-head margin he was beaten by.
He also seems to have finally found his niche over 1400m. The only concern is the fact he is drawn worst of all.
