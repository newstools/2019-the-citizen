So, South African rugby referee Jaco Peyper has been pilloried in public – first on social media and then by World Rugby – for his clowning around with Welsh rugby fans and mimicking the elbow-in-the-face assault for which he red-carded French forward Sebastien Vahaamahina in Saturday’s quarterfinal between Wales and France.

Peyper was forced to apologise for his behaviour and the match officials selection committee “did not consider” him to officiate in the upcoming semi-finals.
This all raises the question of bias and, frankly, whether it is asking a bit much to expect sporting judges to be held to the same rules of propriety and independence as the magistrates and judges in our courts.
International sport has become a very serious and very profitable business and the spoilers have not been far behind. Which is a pity, particularly in the case of rugby, which probably has a more robust sense of humour than most other sports. After all, isn’t it a thugs’ game played by gentlemen?
This should not detract from Peyper’s performance in arbitrating the match, which was superb, and the sending-off was justified.
We feel for you, Jaco, because you didn’t deserve this red card…
