The expected replacement for the Toyota Rush has made it first appearance online mere days after its twin, the Daihatsu Rocky, debuted at the Tokyo Motor Show.
Based on the leaked images published by Autocar India, the new Toyota Raize mainly receives a slightly reworked front facia derived from the Japanese market Noah/Voxy, with elements also taken from the RAV4 such as the dual grille with a more prominent mesh lower intake and redesigned fog light bezels with horizontal daytime running LEDs as opposed to the Rocky’s vertical diodes.
Although no images of the rear or interior were revealed, expect the former to be mildly revised from that of the Rocky with the interior set to be carried over, the sole exception likely being the replacing of the Daihatsu badges with Toyota ones.
As well as the same size and platform, a variation of the GA-B known as Daihatsu New Global Architecture (DNGA), the Raize will also feature the same engine, a 1.0-litre three-cylinder turbocharged petrol producing 72kW/140Nm.
A CVT will initially be the sole transmission option with drive, for now, routed to the front wheels only. According to the report though, a six-speed manual ‘box and four-wheel-drive will become available at a later stage.
While due to go on sale either shortly or at the same time as the Rocky , the Raize, which has been earmarked for developing markets, will, for now, remain forbidden for South Africa, but chances are that this might change sometime next year.
