A nine-year-old boy from Minnesota in the US embarrassed a legion of adult runners by winning a 10km race totally by accident.
According to the St Cloud Times, Kade Lovell had merely entered the 5km category of the event, which was organised by a local church.
His mother, Heather, became worried when she saw Kade’s peers running past her, kids she knew weren’t quicker than her son.
“I had everyone looking for him, even a fireman,” she told the publication.
“I was like, ‘You need to go find my son.’ I was bawling. This had never happened before.”
However, a spectator then called Heather’s brother-in-law, who was also participating in the 10km race, telling him that there was a “little kid who is running very well”.
Heather’s emotions were conflicted when Kade eventually crossed the finish line until organisers informed her that her son had won.
Kade’s finish time was just over 48 minutes, more than a minute faster than his nearest rival, a 40-year-old.
“I was just running,” he said.
“As soon as I saw the 5km turn, a lady told me to keep going straight. So I kept going straight. I was a little confused.”
Heather theorised that: “He actually probably did better than he normally does because he was trying to finish the 5k  and in panic mode.”
Kade started participating in cross country running at age six.
