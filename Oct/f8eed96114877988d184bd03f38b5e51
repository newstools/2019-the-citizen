With just over five days remaining till the Tokyo Motor Show kicks-off, Honda has released the clearest teaser image yet of the highly awaited fourth generation Jazz.
Revealing little bar the silhouette that seems to have been carried over from the previous generation, details have largely been kept under wraps, although it has been reported that the Jazz will be a hybrid only model in Europe.
In Japan though, where the Jazz is sold as the Fit, the mentioned engines are likely to be made of a 1.3 or 1.5 incorporating a dual-mode battery system similar to that of the Insight, with a CVT set to be standard across the range. A brand-new e-CVT will however be optional on four-wheel-drive derivatives.
Outside of Japan and Europe, the Jazz will likely be powered by an assortment of petrol engines ranging from 1.3 to 1.5-litres, but chances are that some countries could receive the 95 kW 1.0-litre turbocharged triple powering the Civic on sportier models.
Expect more details to come to light within the next few days.
