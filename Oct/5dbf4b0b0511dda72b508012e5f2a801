Race 4 No 4 Dark Crystal
Trainer Justin Snaith is notoriously known for his runners winning races despite the disadvantage of returning from layoffs.
With that said, the fact Dark Crystal returns from a 154-day break shouldn’t stand in the way of her recording a second consecutive success today. She was last seen in action when defeating Too Cute a lot easier than the 0.50-length margin suggests.
To strengthen her case, that form line has produced no less than four winners and three runner-up’s.
Bargain Bet
Race 5 No 1 Head Honcho
Head Honcho’s previous form clearly proves he is far better than his Vodacom Durban July twelfth-place finish suggests.
In his defence, he was drawn worst of all and was returning from a short rest. Prior to his last two performances, he was on an impressive three-run winning streak and even finished close-up third in Grade 1 Sun Met.
Head Honcho tops the best-weighted column today and if he reproduces any of those efforts, he will be extremely hard to peg back.
