Race 6 No 2 Believethisbeauty 
This Yvette Bremner-trained mare is a monster over this course and distance and her form proves this having recorded all four career victories over it. She is beautifully drawn at No 6 and her case is further strengthened by the fact she has only missed the first four placings once in eight starts on the synthetic. 
Bargain Bet
Race 5 No 2 Master Newton
Jockey Muzi Yeni should creep a lot closer to the No 1 spot on the national jockeys’ championship log when hat-trick hopeful, Master Newton, returns to his favourite course and distance. Good news is that Gavin Smith’s charge gets 1.5kg from his main danger Elusive Kat.
If Master Newton overcomes the wide draw, he will have no trouble outrunning that rival.
