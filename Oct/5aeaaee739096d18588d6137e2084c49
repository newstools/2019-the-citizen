In South Africa, it is even tougher than it is in Hollywood, because artists are seldom recognised for their talent and are often exploited by those who do profit from their genius.
Now, actors and others are coming together to push President Cyril Ramaphosa to sign the Performers’ Protection Amendment Bill, which should, hopefully, reduce or eliminate what artists say is labour exploitation in the industry.

We need to realise that, much as we have huge problems to deal with in this country, our artists and performers play a vital role not only entertaining us, but also informing us and helping keep society on an even keel.
This is not to say artists should get preferential treatment; but it’s not fair that they get treated like second-class citizens because there are limited opportunities out there.
