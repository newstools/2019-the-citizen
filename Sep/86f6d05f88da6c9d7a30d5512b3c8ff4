As the Proteas frantically try to plug gaps following the retirements of various stalwarts, members of the South African cricketing fraternity gasped at what the national team is missing out on when it comes to Kyle Abbott.
The skillful 32-year-old seamer made waves this week with a stunning haul of 9/40 for Hampshire in their English county championship meeting with Somerset.

Abbott, who has a penchant for eye-catching figures after he took a memorable 7/29 on Test debut against Pakistan in 2013, was relentless, trapping six victims LBW and castling another.
“I didn’t expect this when I woke up, to be honest,” he told Hampshire’s official Twitter account.
“It was nice to get a few early poles and I got on a bit of a roll.”


The humble man from Empangeni was a bit more forthcoming in an interview with ESPNCricinfo.




“I think it has been the best I’ve bowled, definitely the most consistent since 2017,” Abbott, who controversially took the Kolpak route at the beginning of 2017, said.
“It’s the best form I’ve been in for a while.”
Abbott has taken more than 60 wickets for the county this season.
