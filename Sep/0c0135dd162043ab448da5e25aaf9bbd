Having boosted the Swift range with the flagship GLX model last month, Suzuki Auto South Africa has now done to the same to the Ertiga.

Building on the now mid-range GL, the GLX benefits from more equipment, which externally consists out of 15-inch alloy wheels, chrome door handles, front fog light, a chrome strip on the bootlid and LED taillights.
Inside, the touch-panel infotainment system has been dropped in favour of the same seven-inch touchscreen display used on the Swift, Jimny and Ciaz that comes with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, while addition items includes automatic climate control, a 4.2-inch instrument cluster display, a central storage box that doubles up as an armrest, a reverse camera, height adjustable driver’s seat and woodgrain inserts on the dashboard, steering wheel and doors.

Still with seating for seven and with safety spec being unchanged from the GL, the GLX is also unchanged underneath its bonnet where the 1.5-litre K15B petrol engine continues to produce 77kW/138Nm, which is sent to the front wheels via a five-speed manual of four-speed automatic gearbox. Claimed fuel consumption for both is rated at 6.2 L/100 km.
As with the rest of the Ertiga range, the GLX comes standard with a five year/200 000 km warranty and a four year/60 000 km service plan.
