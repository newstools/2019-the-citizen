The Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (Amcu) yesterday wrapped up its three-day national elective congress, with Joseph Mathunjwa being re-elected president.
Mathunjwa, along with five other national office bearers – Jeffrey Mphahlele (general secretary), Jimmy Gama (national treasurer), Mosibo Joni (deputy president), Neo Mankge (national chair: education) and Xolani Bokoloshe (national chair: health and safety) – were elected unopposed in polls run by the Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa.
Among far-reaching resolutions adopted by delegates at the Amcu congress are:

The promotion of technical and artisan skills among members, to be empowered with the dependents through bursaries;
Educating men on the implications on gender-based violence;
A campaign for a basic income grant for the unemployed;
The closing of the wage gap between captains of industry and workers;
The right of workers to refuse an instruction to undertake dangerous work;
A campaign against the department of labour’s move for a secret ballot by workers before embarking on a strike;
A campaign for the independence of the CCMA, to avoid commissioners taking bribes;
A review of the Labour Relations Act (LRA) provision for workers in essential services not to go on strike;
The holding of a jobs summit to adopt a programme of action to address unemployment and retrenchments; and
An end to wage disparity between men and women doing the same job.

The Amcu congress, held every five years, also discussed constitutional amendments and resolved to make a submission to the department of labour’s registrar Lehlohonolo Molefe by the end of next month.
Recently, Amcu patched up differences with Molefe following tensions over a threat to deregister the union over noncompliance with the provisions of the LRA, requiring the union submit to the department audited financial statements and proof of holding regular elective conferences.
