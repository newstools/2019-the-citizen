Transnet Port Terminals (TPT) has conceded that it remained “challenged” about the time trucks spent at the company’s staging area before entering the operational zone.
Asked to comment on concerns expressed by truck drivers on inefficiencies at the Port of Durban, Transnet KwaZulu-Natal Containers corporate affairs manager Sibongile Matsena said: “As a business, we remain challenged with the time trucks spend at the staging area before entering our operational zone. There are also often possibilities of traffic congestion on Bayhead Road by its nature of being within an industrial area.
“There is both container traffic, which is destined for our Durban container terminals and bulk cargo meant for other destinations within the Bayhead vicinity.”
Matsena said in maritime logistics, time taken to discharge a vessel was determined by the number of containers it carried.
“For collection therefore, TPT has a truck turnaround time target of 35 minutes – a time we calculate from the minute a truck enters our operational area. However, in August we averaged 89 minutes. To improve truck turnaround time – TPT’s recommendation to industry is the use of off-peak periods, which includes weekends.
“Other factors are timeous evacuation of import containers; responding to tier-for-tier and group import release requests; as well as increased use of the container booking system.
“Equipment reliability and spares remain a priority and inroads to address this are underway. We continue to uphold communication with all our customers and stakeholders whom we value greatly,” Matsena said.
She also conceded that ablution facilities for drivers were not available at the waiting area.
“Ablution facilities are available at the staging area,” she said.
