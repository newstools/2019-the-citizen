A Free State police officer accused of shooting an 11-year-old boy dead and seriously wounding his ex-girlfriend’s husband, is expected to appear before the Bloemfontein Magistrates’ Court today.
The officer was arrested on Friday following a shooting incident at Batho location in Bloemfontein. It is alleged that the suspect arrived at his ex-girlfriend’s house at about 10pm that night, fired shots with his service pistol, and hit the ex-girlfriend’s husband in his abdomen.
Police spokesperson Thandi Mbambo said the dead boy was the child of the tenant living at the same premises as the couple. Mbambo said one of the bullets apparently penetrated the door separating the couple from the other tenants and hit the child, who was on a couch watching TV.
The police constable is facing charges of murder and attempted murder. The ex-girlfriend’s husband is still receiving treatment at a local hospital.
ER24 spokesperson Werner Vermaak said they were called on Friday night to the Batho police station where they found the man with a gunshot wound to his abdomen.
“ER24 paramedics sent an emergency vehicle to their home where they found the body of the young boy. He had been hit in the chest,” said Vermaak.
