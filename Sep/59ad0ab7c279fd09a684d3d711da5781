Best Bet
Race 4 No 6 Gin Fizz
Conditioner Mike de Kock’s runners are notoriously known for winning races despite the disadvantage of returning from lengthy layoffs.
Such could be the case when Gin Fizz – returning from 143-day rest – lines up in today’s Race 4, over 1200m. She proved she was a quality individual when a jaw-dropping 7.40-length victor on debut.
She has been competing in competitive features ever since and hasn’t been disgraced, recording two seconds and a fourth in a Grade 2. Gin Fizz faces a weaker field this time and considering she tops the best-weighted column, a loss becomes highly unlikely.
Bargain Bet
Race 6 No 1 Strikeitlikeamatch
It won’t be easy for three-time winner Strikeitlikeamatch to defy the top-weight of 60.5kg in this 1000m contest, but he has regained form, finishing second in last two outings.
Most encouraging is the fact the closest he has gone to winning was over this distance in penultimate offering, when gutsily running down Mount Keith to lose by a rapidly diminishing 0.30 lengths.
Barend Botes’ charge reunites with in-form jockey Muzi Yeni and will benefit greatly from the No 2 draw, simply because draws are of paramount importance at this track.
