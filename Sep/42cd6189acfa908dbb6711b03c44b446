Thomas du Toit is en route from France to Nagoya, Japan, on Monday after being called up as an injury replacement to the Springbok Rugby World Cup squad.
The 24-year-old Sharks prop, nicknamed “The Tank”, replaces the unfortunate Trevor Nyakane who tore his right calf in the 23-13 defeat by New Zealand in Yokohama on Saturday night.
Du Toit, who was on a short-term loan to Toulouse, was on standby and had been involved in preparations right up until the team’s departure for Japan.

He is expected to join the squad in Nagoya on Tuesday afternoon.
“It’s very tough on Trevor,” said Rassie Erasmus, director of rugby.
“He has had a great season and added value whenever he took the field. It’s a blow to him and the team, but it’s also an opportunity for Thomas and for Vincent [Koch] who now have the chance to step up.”
The unlucky Nyakane was in tears after coming off and had just managed to recover from a leg injury sustained in the warm-up against Japan to take up his place.
The 30-year-old has been considered one of South Africa’s best props this season.
