The landmark sentencing of convicted cricket match-fixer Gulam Bodi in Pretoria’s Commercial Crimes Court was postponed on Friday due to a dispute over an affidavit submitted by a woman from Newcastle whom he had previously been involved with.
In it, the woman states that the former Proteas batsman, who in late 2018 pleaded guilty on eight corruption charges related to him being central in the 2015/16 domestic T20 spot-fixing scandal, says that Bodi hasn’t paid maintenance.

According to another former national player, Alviro Petersen – who was also banned from all cricket-related activities for two years for failing to disclose relevant information and approaches and attended proceedings – Bodi’s legal representative said that a “negative inference” could be drawn from the accusation that he had not been fulfilling his maintenance responsibilities.


The state argued that the affidavit had no bearing on the case, in the process asking for a sentence of five years.
The case has been postponed till 18 October.


Bodi’s potential imprisonment is significant as he’ll be the first individual to be sentenced under the relatively obscure Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act, which allows for the prosecution of corruption in sporting events.
The act had been introduced in response to the late Proteas captain Hansie Cronje’s match-fixing revelations in 2000.
In January 2016, Bodi was banned from all cricket for 20 years by Cricket South Africa, who also imposed varying suspensions on six other players – Ethy Mbalathi, Jean Symes, Pume Matshikwe, Thami Tsolekile, Lonwabo Tsotsobe and Petersen.
