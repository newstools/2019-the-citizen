As South Africans spent their Sunday afternoons marking the symbolic beginning of Spring, Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba gathered friends and family across varied political lines to celebrate his 60th birthday with him at the Marabi Club in Johannesburg.
Mashaba, who turned 60 on August 26, was joined by the likes of Tembeka Ngcukaitobi, leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA) Mmusi Maimane, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) Julius Malema, and EFF national chairperson Dali Mpofu.




Mashaba even took to the piano to give an impromptu performance during the festivities.


Using the official hashtag, guests took to social media to share pictures and videos from the evening along with birthday wishes for Mashaba.
