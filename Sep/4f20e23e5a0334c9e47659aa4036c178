Race 3 No 9 Rock Aloe 
With the highest win strike-rate in the country at 25.21% there is clearly no better jockey to trust with your money more than Greg Cheyne at the moment.

Bargain Bet
Race 4 No 7 Voices Of Light 
Although Voices Of Light can prove rather expensive to follow when backed for the win, he is undeniably talented and has missed the first three just once in his last seven performances.
The only chink in this gelding’s armour is the fact he returns from a 77-day rest.
Other than that, all is in his favour. He shoulders 5kg less than his main danger Let’s Play Ball at 55kg and jumps from an advantageous No 3 draw. On this evidence, a loss is unlikely.
