Prince Harry, Meghan and their son have finally graced the coastal city of Cape Town for the first leg of their 10-day southern Africa trip.
The tour will begin with an education workshop in one of Cape Town’s townships — areas crippled by gang violence that sit just miles from the city’s stunning beaches and rolling vineyards.
They will then visit District Six museum, a memorial to the forced relocation of some 60,000 non-white residents from the city centre during apartheid.
Harry, who has travelled widely across Africa, jointly founded the charity Sentebale in 2006, to help support children affected by HIV, after spending a gap year in Lesotho.
For some in South Africa, the presence of Meghan — a mixed-race American descended from slaves on her mother’s side — could make this royal visit particularly special.
Baby Archie, at less than five months old, is now one of the youngest royals to take part in an official visit.
The trip will also mark Archie’s first major public appearance since his birth in May.
