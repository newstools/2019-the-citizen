This, according to Punnet Anand, General Manager and Group Head for Hyundai India, who told indianautosblog.com on the sides of the recent Grand i10 Nios launch that such a model could happen if demand dictates it.
“If the customer needs it, then Hyundai will definitely cater to the same. We have a global portfolio and we are looking to explore all possibilities,” Anand said.
As well as the India, the small MPV will likely be available in developing markets only and with dimensions similar to that of the Ertiga, meaning seating for seven and with a projected price tag below Rs 1 000 000 (R211 575).
Based on the online platform’s claims, the new MPV could ride on the same platform as the Venue that will go on sale in South Africa toward the end of this year, and come with the same assortment of petrol and diesel engines.
