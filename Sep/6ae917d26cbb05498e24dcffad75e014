City of Joburg mayor Herman Mashaba is expected to welcome a new fleet for its emergency services amid a severe staff shortage, driven by the suspension of 230 firefighters.
As of last week, 127 of these firefighters had not returned to work after their suspensions were lifted. According to Mashaba, this was despite efforts by the city to try and resolve the dispute amicably.
Last week it emerged that workers, affiliated with trade union Demawusa, had downed tools citing grievances including safety concerns issues with shift allocation.
It was unclear if an end to the strike was near this week, as the union’s spokesperson, Terrence Gafe, refused to comment on the matter, saying it was part of their strategy not to reveal their plans until a press conference is held on Thursday.
According to Mashaba, Emergency Management Services was made aware of the strike action by a group of about 230 firefighters on July 11 this year.
That month, firefighters marched the streets of Joburg over safety concerns, handing over a memorandum of concerns to Mashaba’s office.
