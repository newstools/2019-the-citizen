Best Bet: Race 3 No 1 Para Handy 
Para Handy has shown exceptional form since joining the illustrious Tara Laing yard.
He will attempt to register a third consecutive triumph and remain unbeaten in Port Elizabeth. He has given the runner-up’s weight in his last two outings and won, so there is no reason why he can’t repeat that feat today.
He only shoulders 0.5kg more than main danger Always Dancing.
The good news is, the latter is returning from an 87-day stint off the racetrack, so she is likely to fall victim to ring-rust – making her hard to recommend for the win.
Bargain Bet:  Race 4 No 2 Miss Calypso
Four-time winner Miss Calypso brings decent KwaZulu-Natal into this contest and although she can prove unpredictable, she has won two of her last three starts on the Polytrack surface.
If jockey Ryan Munger can get this four-year-old daughter of Querari to reproduce any of those two performances, she could prove far too good for this lot.
The only real concern is the fact she will have to overcome a shocking No 10 draw in this 11-horse field.
