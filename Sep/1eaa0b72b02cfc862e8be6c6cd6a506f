A large group of government officials, led by ministers,is marching from Church Square to the Union Buildings on Friday, in action aimed at seeing the government recommitting themselves in their stand against gender-based violence in the country.
Ministers and deputy ministers are expected to sign a pledge expressing their commitment to doing all in their power to curb the tide of femicide and other forms of violence against women and children currently gripping South Africa.
They will also deliver a memorandum of demands at the Union building.
Minister of Public Service and Administration Senzo Mchunu and National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) Shamila Batohi are among those in attendance.
