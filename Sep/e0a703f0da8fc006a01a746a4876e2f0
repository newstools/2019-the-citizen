Race 8 No 1 Jacko Boy
Jacko Boy appears to have finally found her niche over the 2 000m trip – yet to miss the first two – and she will be looking to make amends for her latest defeat.
In her defence, she was appallingly drawn on that occasion, so the fact she only got beat a short-heat into second is testament to her ability.
Jack Boy was a runway three-length victor – against a decent field – in her penultimate start and if brings that mentality to the course, a loss will be highly unlikely. She is also better drawn at No 6 today.
