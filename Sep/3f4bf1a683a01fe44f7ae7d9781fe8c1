Nigerian musician Tiwa Savage has become the latest artist to cut ties with South Africa in a show of solidarity against the recent wave of xenophobic attacks in the country.


She was scheduled to perform at the annual event later this month alongside the likes of DJ Zinhle, Corrine Bailey Rae, DJ Shimza, and Lira to name a few.
Savage’s decision was prompted by what seems to be an unverified video of a Nigerian man allegedly being killed by South Africans.
