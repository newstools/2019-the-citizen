Volkswagen’s partnership with Ford for the developing of one another’s next generation pick-up will come to fruition in 2022 when the all-new Amarok makes its world debut.
According to Australia’s carsales.com.au, the Amarok’s arrival will follow that of the new Ranger set for 2021, but according to Volkswagen’s Chief Operating Officer, Ralf Branstatter, the next generation won’t follow the ID.3 in heading the electric route despite Wolfsburg planning 25 electrified models by 2025.
The announcement comes as a surprise after Mitsubishi confirmed that the next Triton will feature a hybrid powertrain, while Ford itself will make an electric F-150 available in North America soon. In addition, Toyota is expected to unveil a hybrid Hilux in 2025 as per its all model electric shift by said year.
What remains unknown though is whether the next Amarok will adopt the engines as the Ranger, which will reportedly include an EcoBoost V6 and a variation of the F-150’s 3.0 Powertstroke V6 diesel.
