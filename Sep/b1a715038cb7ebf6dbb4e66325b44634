With its upscale 200 sibling being the centre of attention in recent months, Toyota South Africa has unveiled a special edition version of the double cab Land Cruiser 79 that pays tribute to one of the toughest areas on the African continent.

Essentially a cosmetic overhaul, the Namib Edition receives a mesh grille with prominent TOYOTA badging, a heavy duty steel front bumper with an integrated nudge bar, a tubular steel tow bar, HID LED spot lights, a snorkel and Namib decals on the tailgate and doors.
Inside, Toyota has added grey canvas seat covers with Namib logos and a special overhead compartment that can accommodate two-way radios as well as their mounting hooks. Underneath, the Namib comes with an upgraded off-road suspension and 16-inch alloy wheels wrapped in 265/75 Cooper Discoverer S/T Maxx tyres.

No changes have taken place underneath the bonnet though where the 4.5 D-4D V8 turbodiesel engine continues to produce 151kW/430Nm, which is fed to the rear or all four wheels via a five-speed manual gearbox with low range. Claimed fuel consumption is 11.3 L/100 km.
Available in Ivory White or Sand Beige, the Namib is priced at R893 600 and comes standard with a three year/100 000 km warranty with a service plan being optional.
