The Free State Cheetahs feasted on a wayward Golden Lions’ mistakes to claim a 31-28 victory in Saturday’s Currie Cup final in Bloemfontein.
It’s the union’s sixth title.
The scoreline flattered the visitors, who were essentially nowhere for 70 minutes before they exploited the Cheetahs’ lack of intensity in the closing moments to score three tries.
While the home side won’t be proud of their defensive effort during that final ten-minute period, they certainly showed far more control and accuracy in establishing a lead that simply became too big to overhaul.
Full report to follow.
