The long awaited successor to the Mazda RX-8 has allegedly taken another step towards becoming reality with the discovery of new patent documents portraying a unique chassis structure.
According to Britain’s Autocar, the single image shows a compact spaceframe design with a double wishbone front suspension and a relatively small engine compartment, which it claims translates to a mid-mounted, front engine layout that is not being used on any of Hiroshima’s current passenger models.
The publication further claims that carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP) and aluminium will be extensively used in the design, and that it could use a turbocharger to boost performance and remove soot and water from the combustion chamber.
Likely to carry the RX-9 moniker with styling from the Vision RX-Concept shown in Tokyo four years ago, the latest findings seemingly confirms the patents leaked by the Garage Alpha forum in June, as well as the sight of two lightly disguised RX-8’s at the Nürburgring two months ago.
While unofficial, it is rumoured that the RX-9’s will be based on the new rear-wheel-drive platform co-developed with Toyota that will also underpin the next Mazda6 and certain Lexus models.
