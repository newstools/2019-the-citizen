The DA is outraged by the death of a baby at the Mahikeng provincial hospital last week.
The infant allegedly sustained burn wounds caused by an incubator and died on the way to a hospital in Pretoria following a transfer.
In a statement, the party said although health MEC Madoda will investigate the incident, they demanded a criminal investigation be launched.
“It is simply unacceptable for any patient to die due to injuries caused by the very health care facility charged with delivering medical treatment and we will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that justice prevails.
“This sorrowful incident again places the spotlight on the poor quality of care provided in provincial medical facilities. Dilapidated buildings, unequalled shortages of equipment, numerous vacancies of critical staff and collapsed Emergency Medical Services will inevitably lead to more deaths if urgent action is not taken.”
