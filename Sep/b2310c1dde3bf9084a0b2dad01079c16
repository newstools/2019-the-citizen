With the all-new M3 reportedly set for unveiling at the Frankfurt Motor Show that kicks-off next week, BMW has released a limited edition version of the M4 ahead of the all-new bowing next year.
Dubbed the Edition M Heritage, the limited to 750 units model will go on sale in November and end production in April next year with the series of changes being mostly limited to cosmetics and on the inside.

Based on the M4 Competition, the M Heritage’s exterior tweaks includes 20-inch Orbit Grey matte M light alloy wheels, the M colours integrated into the carbon fibre reinforced plastic roof (CFRP), and a choice of three unique colours; Imola Red, Laguna Seca Blue and Velvet Blue Metallic.

Inside, the standard issue M sport seats gain a bi-colour design with contrasting stitching, full leather upholstery and red, orange or turquoise ///M Heritage lettering integrated into the headrest, while CFRP inlays with the M colours, Edition ///M Heritage branded door sills and a 1/750 commemorative plaque rounds the changes off.

Up front, the outgoing S55 3.0-litre turbocharged straight-six has been kept unchanged at 331kW/550Nm, with the same applying to the seven-speed M DCT gearbox, the limited top speed of 280 km/h and 0-100 km/h in four seconds.
Although no pricing has been divulged, BMW South Africa has confirmed that 10 units of the Edition M Heritage will be offered for the local market.
