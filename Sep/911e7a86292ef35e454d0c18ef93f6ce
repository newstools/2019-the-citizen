Having teased the new Atos last week, Hyundai South Africa has so far remained mum on announcing whether the outgoing Grand i10 will be replaced by the all-new European-spec model, or the Grand i10 Nios unveiled in India last month. In the meantime, the South Korean automaker has revealed a sporty N Line version of the former at the Frankfurt Motor Show that will go on sale on the Old Continent next year.
Externally, the N Line follows the i20, i30 and Tucson derivatives in mainly receiving a unique bodykit and grille, redesigned bumpers, LED daytime running lights, red i10 badge, a faux rear diffuser and front skidplate, model exclusive 16-inch alloy wheels, N Line badges and a choice of six colours.

Subtle revisions to the interior comes courtesy of alloy pedals, sport seats, red air vent surrounds and an N branded leather wrapped steering wheel and gear lever with red stitching.

While the former is outfitted with a five-speed manual gearbox or a five-speed automated manual (AMT), the force-fed one-litre comes with exclusively paired to the manual.
