Opel’s United Kingdom sister brand, Vauxhall, is reportedly considering bringing the VXR moniker out of hiatus for a performance model of the all-new Corsa.
Citing an alleged source within the French owned British/German automaker, Britain’s Autocar claims that the moniker, which along with Opel’s OPC designation has been dormant since 2018 following the sale to PSA and revival of the GSI nomenclature, will only be revived around 2021 once a suitable engine is found.
Two years ago, carbuyer.co.uk reported that future VXR models could incorporate some form of electrification or plug-in hybrid capability as opposed to an engine with “six or eight cylinder and a turbocharger or two”.
“We haven’t lost this sporting brand, and it will remain at the forefront of performance motoring in the mainstream,” an unnamed Vauxhall spokesperson told the online platform at the time, adding that, “[VXR models] will always be a hardcore offering, with a jump in performance as well as very focussed dynamics”.
Based on the Autocar report, the eventual decision on the ideal engine rests with the Corsa’s PSA stablemate, the stillborn Peugeot 208 GTi, and the sales performance of the all-electric e-Corsa versus the standard petrol engine model.
Like the e-208, the 50 kWh lithium-ion battery pack in the e-Corsa produces 100kW/260Nm, a jump of four kilowatts and 30 Nm compared to the most powerful petrol engine model, the three-cylinder 1.2 PureTech turbo.
When indeed revived, the Corsa VXR (OPC) will take aim at the likes of the Ford Fiesta ST and the Volkswagen Polo GTI, with the publication estimating an output of around 147 kW in order for it to be competitive.
