According to Japan’s Best Car, the name will be used on the production version of the e-Evolution concept shown in Tokyo two years ago, thus confirming comments made earlier this year by the brand’s UK Managing Director, Rob Lindley, that it will focus solely on pick-ups and SUVs.
The report also stands in contrast with that of British publication Autocar, who claimed back in June that the Evo will use alliance partner Nissan-Renault’s CMF-C/D platform, and come powered by the same 2.0-litre turbocharged engine as the next Megane RS that will be boosted by a 48-volt mild-hybrid motor and produce 255kW/433Nm.
With this claiming seemingly unlikely to happen now, the Japanese online platform also reports that the e-Evolution could debut as early as Tokyo next month, though this remains to be seen.
