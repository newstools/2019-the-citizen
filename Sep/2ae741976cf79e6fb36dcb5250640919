Mercedes-Benz executives have reportedly refused to comment on the future of the X-Class amidst on-going reports that it will be a one generation only model.
Back in July, the three-pointed star declined responding to a report by Automotive News Europe, which alleged that sales if its first leisure pick-up, co-developed with the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance and based on the same platform as the Nissan Navara and Renault Alaskan, only stood at 16 700 units across key markets, one being South Africa.
“Our positioning to anything that’s written in the European report overnight is that we do not comment on speculation,” Mercedes-Benz Australia responded to a question by caradvice.com.au on the matter.
In a similar reaction at the Frankfurt Motor Show this week, Mercedes-Benz Vans Communications Chief, Andrea Eberhardt, merely told carsguide.com.au that, “We currently have an X-Class in market, and we are of course interested in finding as many customers for it as possible. That’s all we can say”.
One of the most expensive double cabs on sale in Europe, Australia and here at home, the X-Class’ impact Down Under has largely been unsuccessful with only 1 090 units moved during the first six months of 2019, while a mere 1 545 were sold over the course of 2018.
In South Africa, pricing for the X-Class starts at R642 100 for the X220d Progressive manual, but with Mercedes-Benz South Africa not reporting individual model sales figures, the exact number of X-Class’ sold since its unveiling two years ago is less easier to establish.
