President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced he will seek an urgent judicial review of public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane’s recently released report finding him guilty of misleading parliament regarding donations to his CR17 campaign for the ANC presidency.
The president addressed the media on Sunday evening at 6pm in Pretoria at the Union Buildings.
According to Ramaphosa, Mkhwebane has violated the constitution and the principles of South African common law with her report, which he said is “fundamentally and irretrievably flawed”.
“It is appropriate that the courts of our country make a final and impartial determination on this matter,” he added.
Mkhwebane announced that she had found President Cyril Ramaphosa deliberately mislead parliament when he was confronted on a donation made to his son Andile of R500,000 from Gavin Watson, the CEO of hugely controversial facilities company African Global Operations, formerly known as Bosasa.
“He deliberately misled parliament, in that he should have allowed himself sufficient time to research on a well-informed response,” she said at on Friday a press conference in Pretoria.
