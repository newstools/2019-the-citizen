One of the oldest models in Mazda’s current product range having been around since 2014, the Japanese automaker has now officially divulged details of the heavily facelifted 2 due out in its home market on 12 September.
Aesthetically, the 2 comes with new headlights incorporating optional Adaptive LEDs, a tweaked grille similar to that of the new 3, chrome detailing, a sculpted front bumper, newly designed alloy wheel, and a redesigned rear bumper.
Despite appearing unchanged, the 2’s interior is said to “balance quality and playfulness” in that it receives upgraded materials, an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, more sound deadening insulation materials, electric driver’s seats and upgraded software for the seven-inch MZD Connect infotainment system that also benefits from Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. New safety and driver assistance tech consists of Lane Keep Assist, Radar Cruise Control and Mazda’s G-Vectoring Control Plus system.

In Japan, where Mazda has opted to end the Demio moniker after 23 years for the domestic market 2, a choice of two engines will be offered; the 1.5 SkyActiv-G petrol in two states of tune; 81kW/141Nm or 85kW/148Nm and the new 1.8 SkyActiv-D turbodiesel that is expected to make 85kW/270Nm.
While drive will go the front wheels via a six-speed manual or optional six-speed automatic transmission, all-wheel-drive will also be available albeit only with the self-shifting ‘box.
In total, the 2 will come in eight trim levels; the petrol line-up made up of S, S Proactive, Proactive S Package, S L Package and the manual, two-wheel-drive only MB outfitted with the 85 kW engine, while the diesel will come in XD Proactive, XD Proactive S Package, and XD L Package.

Pricing meanwhile starts at ¥1 544 400 (R200 192) for the 15 S manual or automatic and tops-out at ¥2 610 000 (R338 321) for the all-gripping XD L Package diesel automatic in a range consisting out of 22 models.
No indication of local availability has yet been made, although expect the updated 2 to arrive either towards the end of this year or in early 2020 with the existing line-up of engines; the 82kW/145Nm 1.5-litre SkyActiv-G petrol and the 77kW/250Nm 1.5 SkyActiv-D turbodiesel.
