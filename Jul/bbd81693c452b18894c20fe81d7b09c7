The recently revealed unemployment stats have prompted many to weigh in on the state of the nation and what a 29% unemployment rate means for both the economy and the future of South Africa.
While the country’s initial reaction was shock and disappointment, many have offered up their detailed opinion on where the real problem lies.
One such contributor is former eNCA-host-turned-political-commentator and entrepreneur Justice Malala.
According to Malala, “Gupta deployees and Guptists” such as Ace Magashule are affecting “fantastic human being” Cyril Ramaphosa’s ability to govern.


Malala’s opinion garnered a strongly worded response from deputy president of the Economic Freedom Fighters Floyd Shivambu who declared that “the only way to describe this is that word DJ Fresh was wrongfully fired for.”


Malala’s own followers seemed to share Shivambu’s stance as they questioned Malala’s position.
