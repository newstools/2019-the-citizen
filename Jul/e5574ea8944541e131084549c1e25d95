Unveiled almost exactly 12 months ago, the Q3 swaps the dated PQ35 platform for the now widely used MQB, with the mini-Q8 arriving on local shores, based on Audi’s online configurator, with a choice of three trim levels; base, Advanced and S line and powered by a single turbocharged petrol engine.
For now, South Africans will only be privy to the new 1.5 TFSI Evo motor that punches out 110kW/250Nm, and which is paired to a six-speed S tronic gearbox with drive being routed to the front wheels. In this guise, the Q3 will carry the 35 TFSI moniker and reach a top speed of 204 km/h with the 0-100 km/h dash taking 8.9 seconds.
In term of equipment, and depending on the trim level, the Q3 comes with the sport suspension, MMI Navigation Plus infotainment system with Bluetooth and smartphone interface, the Audi premium sound system, Alcantara/leatherette or leather/leatherette trimmed front sport seats with lumbar support, dual-zone climate control, 17-inch alloy wheels, the ambient lighting package, aluminium scuff plates, Hill Descent Control, rear parking sensor and a digital instrument cluster.

The extensive options lists meanwhile includes 18-inch or 19-inch alloys (R12 900 and R22 900), Matrix LED headlights (R7 200), a leather wrapped flat-bottom sports steering wheels (R3 300), S line sport seats (R15 900), a 360-degree camera system (R13 500), Audi Drive Select (R3 300), Lane Departure Warning (R5 800), the Virtual Cockpit Display instrument cluster (R3 900), Park Assist Plus (R6 600), High Beam Assist (R2 300), a Bang & Olufsen 3D sound system (R8 900) and an electric tailgate (R6 500).
While the various options can be specified as standalone items, most are grouped together into specific packages such as the technology (R33 500), comfort (R21 500), S line interior (R15 900) and sports (R34 900) packs.

In total, the Q3 will have a choice of nine colours; Ibis White, Pulse Orange, Glacier White Metallic, Myth Black Metallic, Chronos Grey Metallic, Floret Silver Metallic, Nano Grey Metallic, Cosmos Blue Metallic and Tango Red Metallic.
