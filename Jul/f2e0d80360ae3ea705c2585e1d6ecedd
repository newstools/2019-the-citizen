A massive operation led by the Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) in Marabastad, the western precinct of Pretoria central, resulted in the confiscation of counterfeit goods with an estimated value of R5 million.
On Wednesday, TMPD spokesperson Senior Superintendent Isaac Mahamba said the brand owners of the counterfeited goods and other law enforcement agencies were also part of the crime-fighting blitz.
“Three shop owners were arrested for hiring three illegal immigrants. Home affairs officers also charged each shop owner R2,500 in addition to the arrest,” said Mahamba.
“These operations will also be conducted in other areas. Well done to all law enforcement officers for a successful operation.”
