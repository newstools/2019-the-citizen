Modiehi Thulo, mother to celebrity Boity Thulo, found herself having to explain her position on anal sex after claiming on Monday that she has seen “many people dying from constant anal sex.”
Thulo was responding to a tweet from the popular “Sco pa tu manaa?” trend.
What does “Sco pa tu manaa?” mean?
The trend began when a post containing the phrase went viral leading to questions about what it meant.
Those who had seen the post over and over again tried to use Google translate in order to decipher its meaning but could not arrive at a comprehensive answer.
The phrase was initially thought to have been of Asian origin but this has since been disproven and it has gone on to be attributed to various languages.








For now, Twitter has reached a consensus that it means “what does this make you think of?” and users have been tweeting images and phrases in an effort to solicit comment from other users about certain topics.
As such, Thulo shared her thoughts on anal sex by tweeting: “I’ve seen many, many people dying from constant anal sex. The muscles on the anus don’t contract back after sex, once the sphincter muscle laxity is reached, nothing can be retained. Hence people start wearing adult napkins.”

The tweet which has since been liked over 900 times, shared 700 times and received over 300 responses sparked a conversation about how factual the claims in her tweet are.










Some even deemed the tweet homophobic/a breeding ground for homophobia.




Thulo defended her tweet claiming to have had first-hand experience due to her profession.

It’s my field of work, seen it since 1994 . https://t.co/AJsdSaK2eI

She went on to challenge the perception that her tweet was only targeted at members of the LGBT community.

This honestly has got nothing to do with them. https://t.co/U1cn7lBSFa

This has honestly nothing to do with being gay. https://t.co/ubc8R3F5ta

I’m being inclusive. Females do anal sex too. https://t.co/yo9SIqER2C

There were many who agreed with and even vouched for Thulo’s position on the matter.



Anal cancer too https://t.co/QeYQZTR0Lg

Thulo explained her position by adding her reasoning for making her statement.

Could be anal cancer or the fact that they cannot retain food or liquids. https://t.co/KAFDsICRho

There’s nothing wrong with anal sex, the problem is doing it constantly without breaks to give your anus time to heal or recuperate. https://t.co/WUR21gWyml
