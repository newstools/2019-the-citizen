On sale internationally since 2013 as the initiator of Munch’s i-range of dedicated electric or plug-in hybrid models, the report from Britain’s Auto Express alleges that the i3, which underwent a facelift two years ago, has come under renewed focus due to the brand’s more growing inclusion or availability of mass-produced electric cars.
“It is difficult to say if the i3 will have a straight successor as it [electrification] goes more into the mainstream. The i3 had a pioneering role – it was at the very beginning of BMW’s electrification plans but what we are seeing now is that electrification is moving more into the mainstream,” BMW Management Board Member of Sales, Pieter Nota, told the publication.
Along with the i8, the i3 rates as the only other model to ride on a carbon fibre platform, which, according to publication, will soon be phased out for the existing CLAR architecture, though Nota has stated that, “we will continue to use carbon fibre but not exactly in the way that we see it in the i3 today”.
Last month, newly elected BMW M boss, Markus Flasch, confirmed that the performance division will make the switch to electrification in order to “make our cars faster and enhances their performance”, further adding that there is “no contradiction in having EVs for both sub-brands”.
