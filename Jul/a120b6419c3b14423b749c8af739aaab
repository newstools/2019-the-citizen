Based on the report from Autocar India, the newcomer will allegedly be the production version of the Daihatsu DN-Tec Concept (pictured) shown in Tokyo two years ago, but like the Rush, which is in fact the third generation Daihatsu Terios, will be a badged as a Toyota in markets where Daihatsu has no presence.

Set to measure 3.98 m, which will allow it to compete in the crucial sub-four metre category in India, the yet-as-unnamed model will be based on the TNGA platform that underpins the C-HR, Prius, Corolla, RAV4 and certain Lexus models, and come powered by a 1.0-litre petrol engine, with the reported option of front-or-four-wheel-drive.

Given that the Rush has amassed impressive sales figures in South Africa since its debut last year, it would be interesting to see whether the new crossover, which the publication claims will rival the Suzuki Jimny, will be earmarked for local introduction in the next year or so.
