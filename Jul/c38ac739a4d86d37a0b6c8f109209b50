Already on sale in Thailand, and reviving a name last used in 2002, the Granvia, which will replace the aging Tarago, better known as the Previa, will head Down Under in two trim levels; base and VX with a choice of six or eight-seats and despite its workhorse routes, feature a more upmarket interior and finishes.
According to reports, standard equipment will include front and rear climate control, a touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, up to six USB ports, keyless entry and in the case of VX, leather quilted seats, dual electric sliding doors and an electrically folding backrest for the third row.

Given Australia’s stringent safety regulations, the Granvia will come with Toyota’s Safety Sense system that consists out of up to nine airbags, Pre-Collision Braking with Pedestrian and Cyclists Detection, Adaptive Cruise Control, Auto High Beam Assist, Traffic Sign Recognition, Lane Departure Warning, Blind Spot Monitoring, Rear Cross Traffic Alert, front and rear parking sensors and a reverse camera.
Although Toyota has not revealed technical details, chances are that the Granvia will come solely powered by the 2.8 GD-6 turbodiesel engine taken from the Hilux, Fortuner and Land Cruiser Prado sold Down Under with the familiar outputs of 130kW/450Nm.

As the latter figure states, the Granvia will be fitted as standard with the six-speed automatic gearbox, although chances are that it might also couple the ‘box with the optional 3.5-litre V6 sourced from the Chinese market Prado that makes 206kW/365Nm.
Based on varying reports, the Granvia could carry a sticker price of between $50 000 (R489 037) to $70 000 (R684 652), however, its chances of debuting in South Africa as a plusher version of the Quantum appears highly unlikely.
