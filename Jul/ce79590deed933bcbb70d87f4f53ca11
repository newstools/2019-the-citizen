While a report from Germany’s Autobild as far back as 2017 alleged that Wolfsburg had confirmed that the tiny Taigun, shown as a concept in India five years ago, would go on sale next year as the T-Track, the latest claims from Wards Auto alleges that the newcomer will only be introduced in the second quarter of 2021 with production due for the Landaben Plant near the famed Spanish city of Pamplona.

The production facility that also makes the Polo and indeed the T-Cross, the T-Track, its final designation remains to be confirmed for sure, will reportedly ride on the MQB A0 platform like it intended siblings, and will also feature hybrid and electric powertrains when it goes on sale.

“Since the new model uses the same mechanical platform as those already built in Landaben, we can use the same manufacturing lines for it as for the Polo and the T-Cross, obtaining synergies that will allow us to manufacture it at competitive costs,” Volkswagen Brand Executive Committee Member for Production and Logistics, Andreas Tostmann, was quoted by the online publication as saying.

The introduction of the T-Track could therefore result in Volkswagen ending the CrossPolo moniker which, until now, has not made the transition into the current generation model.
