The Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, has referred the report on Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MPs’ disruption and removal during Minister Pravin Gordhan’s budget vote to the subcommittee on the physical removal of members from the Chamber.
Modise received the report on what transpired during the sitting from House chairperson Matlala Boroto, who presided over the debate on 11 July.
Deputy Speaker Lechesa Tsenoli chairs the subcommittee, which reports to the Rules Committee. It is responsible for considering the circumstances of the physical removals of MPs and must look into the conduct of the member(s), the ruling by the presiding officer and how the member(s) was removed.
The subcommittee will then report its findings and recommendations within 10 working days to the Rules Committee, which, based on that report, will determine the appropriate course of action.
