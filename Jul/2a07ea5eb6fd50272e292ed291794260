15 – ANTHONY VOLMINK (GRIQUAS)
The former Lion has found a new lease of life since his move to Kimberley. Illustrated once again his X-factor with a fabulous individual try, while his positional play was sound.
14 – CORNAL HENDRICKS (BLUE BULLS)
Rassie Erasmus didn’t say he was unlucky to miss out on a Bok recall for nothing. Upheld his high standards in a game where most of his teammates were poor.
13 – BENHARD JANSE VAN RENSBURG (FREE STATE CHEETAHS)

The much-maligned former Shark didn’t remotely look comfortable as a flyhalf at senior level, but a move to Bloemfontein and a new position has seen him gradually flourish. Rewarded with a good brace of tries and defended his channel well.
12 – JEREMY WARD (SHARKS)
Beats out quite a few candidates simply because of the pressure of his role in a team under a harsh spotlight. He was at the heart of the Durbanites’ defensive effort against Province and broke the line twice despite only carrying ball four times.
11 – LWAZI MVOVO (SHARKS)
Much like Hendricks, the veteran winger showed a relish for work and reminded all of his nose for the tryline.
10 – TIAN SCHOEMAN (FREE STATE CHEETAHS)
Given that he received an almighty smack to the head early, the Cheetahs pivot recovered well and managed his playbook superbly on a night where his teammates were switched-on.
9 – TIAN MEYER (FREE STATE CHEETAHS)
Another position where there weren’t standout candidates, but the Free State skipper deserves plaudits for a composed if unspectacular performance.
8 – HENCO VENTER (FREE STATE CHEETAHS)

This underrated, versatile loose forward was outstanding at Loftus. He scored a try, he gained 110 running metres, tackled like a demon, won three line-outs and even stole one. It was an all-action showing.
7 – SIAS KOEN (GRIQUAS)
For the second successive week cracks our nod. The momentum he provides as ball-carrier was eye-catching.
6 – ERNST VAN RHYN (WESTERN PROVINCE)

Rapidly starting to showcase why he’s been such a highly regarded player at junior and Varsity Cup level. Combined his typically watertight defence with a bustling attacking performance.
5 – RUBEN VAN HEERDEN (SHARKS)
Any player that completes an incredible 30 tackles in one game – six of them dominant – deserves recognition.
4 – SALMAAN MOERAT (WESTERN PROVINCE)
The former Junior Bok captain impressed with a varied performance, one where he actively sought to play a bigger role on attack while never neglecting his more mundane duties.
3 – COENIE OOSTHUIZEN (SHARKS)
Showed his experience with some powerful scrummaging, while he tackled his heart out – to the tune of 22 take-downs.
2 – KERRON VAN VUUREN (SHARKS)

Joined the club of heroes on defence.
1 – OX NCHE (FREE STATE CHEETAHS)
There are still a few question marks over some of his technical skills in the set-pieces, but his dynamism and ball-carrying is something to behold.
