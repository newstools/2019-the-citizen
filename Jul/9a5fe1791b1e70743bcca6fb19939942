The United Democratic Movement (UDM) on Thursday called on the Eastern Cape Department of Education to renovate the Zanokhanyo Junior Secondary School in Butterworth after the school was forced to close its doors earlier this week.
The school, with a reported 471 learners, shut down because of the dilapidated building which has rotten pit latrines, holes in the walls, and snakes that are found in classrooms.
According to media reports, parents say the environment is unsafe for their children and they have been waiting for over a decade for the department to come up with a solution.
UDM general secretary Bongani Msomi said that instead of fixing infrastructure, Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga was busy introducing new subjects like Swahili or Mandarin into the curriculum as if it was normal.
“We understand that the government means well by this gesture, but it demonstrates that its priorities are skewed.
“We want a government that focuses on basic necessities such as teaching material and the development or maintenance of school infrastructure. This will be enough to boost the morale and motivate educators to do their job and learners to concentrate on their work.”
Eastern Cape department of education spokesperson Mali Mtima reportedly said the department had assessed the school. Mtima said there was a huge backlog and insufficient funds. He said various schools needed around R73 billion for infrastructure but that the department only had R1.5 billion at its disposal. The UDM called for the monies to be used for renovation so the school could be re-opened as soon as possible.
