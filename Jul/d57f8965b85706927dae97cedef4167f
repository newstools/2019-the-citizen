The current unrest in Zululand, KwaZulu-Natal is linked to the murder of a prominent bus driver on Wednesday evening. It is alleged that the driver was robbed and stabbed by alleged substance abusers, reports Zululand Observer.
The protest action attracted hordes of community members intent on ridding the CBD of suspected dealers and substance abusers.

A short while ago, riot police used stun grenades to disperse a group of over 500 who were stoning a building opposite Taxi City, the location of a night club and other businesses.
Earlier, stalls at the rear end of the taxi rank, next the SMME Park, had been set alight.
A car was also torched.
The situation remains tense amid a large police presence.
