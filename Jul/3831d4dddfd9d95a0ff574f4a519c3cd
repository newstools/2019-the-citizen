Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola will on Wednesday provide legal advice to members of the public at the Legal Aid Advice Line in Johannesburg, Gauteng.
Spokesperson for the ministry Chrispin Phiri said the justice minister’s move to provide legal advice and interactions at the Legal Aid Advice Line form part of “Mandela Month” commemorations.

“It is envisaged that the minister will also interact with Legal Aid South Africa staff on challenges they encounter while executing their daily tasks and conclude his visit by undertaking a walkabout to identify opportunities for modernisation initiatives,” said Phiri.
Phiri said members of the public were encouraged to call 0800 110 110 or send a please call me on 079 835 7179 to interact with the minister.
