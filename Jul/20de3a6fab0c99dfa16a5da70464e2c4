Police in KZN said they arrested two suspects on Monday morning in connection with the alleged murder of two school security guards.
The two guards were found dead earlier this month at a school in Mpumalanga, Hammersdale, in the province.
Provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Thulani Zwane said the security guards, aged 30 and 48, were found at the scene with assault wounds to the head and a crowbar was found next to them.
Zwane said the two suspects were arrested in the early hours of Monday morning by members of the Mpumalanga police, Inanda Task Team, and Magma security.
The suspects were arrested at Amaoti in Inanda, near Durban.
“The arrested suspects, aged 23 and 28, will appear in court soon,” Zwane said.
