Highlighting all of the Blue Oval’s current and future commercial vehicles, the single slide, obtained by carscoops.com, reveals that while the new Puma will be limited to Europe, the Bronco will in fact be destined for North America and the Middle East & Africa, while the so-called Baby Bronco will only be sold in North and South America.
Although chances are slim given that the F-series range is also offered in certain African market but only in left-hand-drive (LHD), the prospect of a RHD Bronco still exists as it will ride on the same T6 platform as the locally made Ranger, Ranger Raptor and Everest, as well as the North American Ranger made at the Wayne Plant in Michigan.
Although Ford has remained largely secretive about the first model to wear the iconic Bronco nameplate since 1996, previous reports have claimed that the reported rival for the Jeep Wrangler will come powered by the North American Ranger’s 2.3 EcoBoost engine that pumps out 200kW/420Nm, while the bigger 2.7 EcoBoost used in the F-150, Edge ST and certain Lincoln models has also been rumoured.
Given that the presentation rules out at the Bronco as heading for Europe and the Asia-Pacific market, one of each being Australia, it remains to be seen if a RHD example does indeed become a reality when the covers are taken off next year.
