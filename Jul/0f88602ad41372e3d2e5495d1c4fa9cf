Although spec has already been announced with buyers having the option of three trim levels; Trendline, Comfortline and Highline with the R-Line styling pack being optional on the latter pair, the Wolfsburg automaker as confirmed that its Plug and Play smartphone app will become available when the T-Cross lands.
More crucially however is that the range, at launch, will only consist out of the Comfortline and Highline, both powered by the 1.0 TSI that punches out 85kW/200Nm, and which is mated solely to a seven-speed DSG.
Arriving in the second quarter of next year, the Trendline, which will carry a sticker price of below R300 000, will feature the same engine albeit detuned to 70kW/160Nm and mated to a five-speed manual gearbox, while the 1.5 TSI Evo motor outputting 110kW/250Nm will debut in the first quarter of 2020. Like the 85 kW 1.0 TSI, the 1.5 TSI Evo will only be offered in conjunction with the DSG. In all models, drive is routed to the front wheels only.
Volkswagen has meanwhile announced that the T-Cross pre-order book will open on 15 July with pricing of R334 600 for the Comfortline and R365 000 for the Highline.
Standard on all models will be a three year/120 000 km warranty and a three year/45 000 km service plan.
