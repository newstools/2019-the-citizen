Footage of a man fearlessly driving into the ocean has surfaced, all apparently because of a dare from his friends.
The footage shows the brave soul charging towards the waves in a light blue car. The man, who was apparently on holiday in KwaZulu-Natal, was left unharmed.
News24 reports that local Ski Boat secretary Brenda Johnson confirmed the bizarre incident happened on Monday.
“Somebody came running into my office and said there is a car in the bay. When I went to look, the car was floating and the man was standing there giving people the thumbs up, indicating he was not injured or in distress.”
The car was pulled out of the ocean by tractor. Watch the clip below:
