Until now offered solely with a five year/unlimited km warranty, the addition of the service plan applies to 13 models in the local line-up, with no mechanical or spec changes taking place.
As before, the Picanto comes in four trim levels; Start, Street, Style and Smart with the latter offering the option of an electric sunroof. Motivation comes from a choice of two petrol engines; a 1.0-litre three-cylinder developing 49kW/95Nm and a 1.2-litre four-pot that produces 61kW/122Nm. Depending on the spec, both motors can be paired to a five-speed manual or the mentioned four-speed automatic.
