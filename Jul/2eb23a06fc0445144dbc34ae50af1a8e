Springs police spokesperson Capt Johannes Ramphora said a man was hijacked on the N12 last Tuesday, reports Springs Advertiser.
The victim was driving a Toyota bakkie when he pulled over to the side of the road after the Mercedes-Benz driving behind him kept flashing its lights at him.
After he parked on the side of the road, one suspect came up to the driver’s side of the car and started talking to the man.
While they were talking, the suspect suddenly pulled the keys out of the ignition and dragged him out of the car.
The other suspect shoved the man into the backseat of the bakkie and blindfolded him.
The victim was eventually dumped in Alexandra after the suspects had the victim’s bank PIN, bags, and cellphone.
The suspects drove off in the bakkie and no arrests have yet been made.
