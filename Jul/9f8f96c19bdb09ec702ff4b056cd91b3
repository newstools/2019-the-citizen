South Africans have been warned to brace for another cold front that is expected to begin from late Thursday night – especially in the Western Cape.
Storm Report SA‘s forecast paints a grim picture for Western Cape residents, who were in for a wet weekend and next week. The cold front will unfortunately also bring snowfall over the southern parts of the country, especially over the Outeniqua and Swartberg mountain ranges.
“It’s the second front that will drench the Western Cape with heavy rainfall and snow. We have a particular interest in the front next week as this could be a beast of [a] winter storm for the country,” warned Storm Report SA.
The cold front could move inland, bringing low temperatures and enough moisture to bring snowfall to a couple of areas, added Storm Report SA.
Light snowfall was also expected over the Eastern Cape around the Barkly East and Elliot areas on Saturday.

“The stronger cold front is expected next week Tuesday which could bring heavy rainfall to the Western Cape and the coastal areas of the Eastern Cape. This cold front could bring good amounts of snow for SA as well …”
Storm Report SA warned that the long-range forecast was subject to change.
