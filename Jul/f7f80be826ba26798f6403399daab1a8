Rescue Care paramedics arrived on the scene “to find carnage”, Rescue Care spokesman Garrith Jamieson said.
“Two vehicles had collided head-on. One vehicle, the driver was found trapped in the wreckage with major injuries. Unfortunately, there was nothing paramedics could do and the man was declared deceased on the scene.”
Three other people from the second vehicle had sustained serious injuries and were stabilised on the scene before being transported under advanced life support care to nearby hospitals for the further care that they required.
