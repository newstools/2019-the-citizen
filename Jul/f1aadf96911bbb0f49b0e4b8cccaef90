Two bizarre videos of men involved in random acts of crazy have surfaced and suggest many of us are mere mortals compared to these men who seem to be from Mount Olympus.
The first video, alleged to be from an Engine garage in Hatfield, shows a man in the early hours of the morning, stupidly pushing a food shelf to the ground.
The motive for the Hulk-like behavior is still unknown, although the man’s brute strength is overshadowed by his chimp-like acts of throwing food at some of the staff afterwards. We assume the man had one or two drinks too many – or maybe too many fizzy drinks – as the reason for his apparent madness.


The second video gets even more bizarre as a man dives through a window at what appears to be a house party. The man, who can be seen losing his footing as people try to check if he is OK, makes a shocking discovery – that he doesn’t have to use the door for his exit, but instead, has the window option.
He can be seen diving through the window. Moments later, he resurfaces and gives a freakish scream, as though to inform onlookers that he had survived the dive, including the landing.
