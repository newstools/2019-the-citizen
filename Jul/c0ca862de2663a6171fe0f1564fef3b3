Robert du Preez’s stormy stint in charge of the Sharks has come to an end.
On Wednesday, at the same time the Sharks revealed that Eduard Coetzee would be the new CEO, taking over from Gary Teichmann, they also announced that Du Preez had moved on.
Under Du Preez’s reign, the Sharks finished eighth in Super Rugby in 2017 and 2018.
This season, they managed to make the play-offs, but crashed out in the quarterfinals.
More than that, though, Du Preez’s relationship with the media was problematic and he even went so far as to label certain reporters as “cockroaches”.


The Sharks have not named a head coach to replace Du Preez as yet because they are currently focused on the Currie Cup.
Sean Everitt is the man in charge of the Sharks in the Currie Cup.
