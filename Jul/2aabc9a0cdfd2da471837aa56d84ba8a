President Cyril Ramaphosa on Wednesday warned that government departments and structures working in “silos” was a huge deterrent to investment and development in the country.
Tabling the presidency budget, Ramaphosa cited the example of how the introduction of stringent visa regulations had a massive impact on the tourism sector.
“The truth is that a lack of coordination between national and provincial government departments and at local government level has not served our country well,” he said.
“We have slid into a pattern of operating in silos, where each government department, each structure of government operates on its own without much reference to each other.”
