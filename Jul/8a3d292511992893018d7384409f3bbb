Originally set to have worn the Q4 moniker, the Sportback is aimed directly at the BMW X2 and incoming Mercedes-Benz GLA, and despite retaining the same design all the way to the C-pillar as the standard Q3, is longer in overall length by measuring 4.50 m as opposed to 4.48 m.
Elsewhere, the Sportback is lower (1.56 m vs. 1.58) and narrower (1.84 vs. 1.85) but keeps the same 2.68 m wheelbase. In terms of boot space, Audi claims a total capacity of 530-1 400-litres, the former being the same as the regular Q3 while the latter figure is 125-litres down.
As mentioned, the most prominent exterior change is from the C-pillar back with a larger rear overhang, flat D-pillar, sloping roofline with an integrated boot spoiler, a restyled rear bumper incorporating a faux diffuser, curved rear window and black cladding around the wheel arches and door sills.

Unlike the exterior, the Sportback’s interior is virtually unchanged from its sibling with the 10.25-inch Virtual Cockpit Display instrument cluster being standard, while optional extras includes the bigger 12.3-inch display, the 10.1-inch MMI Navigation plus infotainment system and a 3D Bang & Olufsen sound system.
Safety and driver assistance tech is similar to the Q3’s and consists of Lane Departure Warning, Pre-Sense accident detection, Lane Change Warning, Adaptive Cruise Control, Automatic Park Assist, Rear Cross Traffic Alert and a 360 degree camera system.
In Europe, the Sportback will go on sale with a choice of two 48-volt mild-hybrid engines; the petrol-powered 45 TFSI whose 2.0-litre motor produces 169kW/350Nm, and the diesel engine 35 TDI that utilises the same sized engine, albeit with outputs of 110kW/340Nm.

Despite both being teamed to a seven-speed S tronic gearbox, the TDI sends its power to the front wheels only with the TFSI being equipped with the quattro all-wheel-drive system as standard. More powerunits and a manual gearbox will be added at a later stage.
Going on sale in the European autumn, the Q3 Sportback will carry a price tag of €40 200 (R624 058) in Germany for the 35 TDI S tronic with the 45 TFSI quattro S tronic commanding a sticker of €46 200 (R717 201).
