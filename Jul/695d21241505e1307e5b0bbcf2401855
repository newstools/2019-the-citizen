Despite previous reports suggesting that the 43 moniker would have been replaced by the mild-hybrid 53 designation, the GLC, until the all-new next generation debuts, soldiers on with the proven 3.0-litre turbocharged V6 that has now been tweaked to deliver 287 kW instead of 270 kW with torque remaining unchanged at 520 Nm.
Paired to the nine-speed TCT dual-clutch gearbox with the AMG Performance 4Matic all-wheel-drive system sending the amount of twist to all four wheels, the GLC 43 will now complete the 0-100 km/h dash in 4.9 seconds regardless of bodystyle, and on to a limited top speed of 250 km/h.

Like the standard GLC, the 43 comes with a redesigned albeit AMG specific front bumper with matte black slashes over the air vents, the now obligatory GT R inspired Panamericana grille, restyled headlights, a new lower rear apron, tweaked taillights and a choice of five alloy wheel designs with sizes ranging from 19 to 21-inches.
Inside, the interior upgrades appear just as subtle, though the infotainment system now incorporates the much vaunted MBUX software with the ‘Hey Mercedes’ interface and gesture control integrated into the still freestanding 10.25-inch display, while the 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster with three background displays (Classic, Sport and Supersport) has also been included.

AMG bespoke details meanwhile includes the AMG Performance steering wheel trimmed in Dinamica micro-fibres and with red 12 o’clock marking, sport seats finished in black Artico man-made leather/Dinamica with red stitching, galvanised paddle shifters, aluminium inlays and a choice of two new interior colour combinations; Magma Grey/black leather and Cranberry/black leather.

In spite of eschewing the optional Off-Road Engineering Package that can be specified on the regular GLC, both 43 variants come with the reworked AMG Dynamics system that boasts five modes now under two umbrella terms; Comfort and Slippery under the ‘Basic’ designation, and Sport, Sport+ and Individual as part of the ‘Advanced’ selection.

In addition to this, the Electronic Stability Control system can be configured from two settings; Stable and Agile, while the Air Body Control air suspension has been included along with the AMG Ride Control dampers that offers three modes of its own accord; Comfort, Sport and Sport+.
