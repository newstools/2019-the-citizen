As indicated by the single teaser image and subsequent leak, the Pajero Sport follows the Eclipse Cross, updated ASX, the South-East Asian market Xpander MPV and the model on which it is based, the Triton, in receiving Mitsubishi’s Dynamic Shield front facia consisting of a new front bumper and grille, thinner headlights with integrated daytime running LEDs, a redesigned bonnet an restyled fog lights.
One of the most controversial design pieces, the heavily criticised rear-end, has been subtly updated with the vertical LED taillights now featuring smoked clusters and no longer cutting into the bumper, itself having been revised to incorporate a new satin silver skidplate. A spoiler integrated into the bootlid rounds the changes off.

Inside, the updates are just prominent, consisting of the new eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, a revised centre console with more leatherette trim and a storage tray, new second row air-conditioning vents, a eight-inch digital instrument cluster and a kick-motion opening electric tailgate on some models.

In addition, Mitsubishi has also added Rear Cross Traffic Alert and Lane Change Assist to the Sport’s safety spec sheet, while the new Mitsubishi Remote Control app allows for the doors to be locked and the tailgate opened via smartphone.
Build at Mitsubishi’s Laem Chabang Plant in Thailand, the Sport’s engine has remained unchanged with the 2.4 DI-D turbodiesel engine once again producing 133kW/430Nm, which is channelled to the rear wheels via an eight-speed automatic gearbox. As before, the Super-Select II four-wheel-drive system will also be available on certain derivatives.

In Thailand, pricing for the Sport kicks-off at 1 299 000 baht (R585 245) for the two-wheel-drive and at 1 599 000 baht (R720 405) for the four-wheel-drive, with local availability and specification set to be revealed closer to the local launch date, anticipated to be in early 2020.
