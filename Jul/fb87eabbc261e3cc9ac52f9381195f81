Thousands of City of Tshwane workers flooded Madiba Street in central Pretoria and caused traffic congestion on Thursday, demanding salary adjustments as well as labour brokering to be done away with.
The protests disrupted traffic which prompted authorities to redirect traffic to other streets around the country’s capital.
SA Municipal Workers Union (Samwu) members chanted struggle songs outside the Tshwane Municipal offices and demanded to be addressed by mayor Stevens Mokgalapa.
According to Samwu, the municipality’s top directors received 18% increases since 2017, to the exclusion of lower-ranked municipal workers.
The mass action by thousands of workers from various departments is a demonstration that workers wanted the same 18% increase twice for each year the senior directors had received it, the union demanded.
Samwu’s Tshwane deputy regional secretary, Valentine Matlala, said the City of Tshwane had been upgraded in ranking meaning that its workers could be paid more.
However, workers were left upset after the increases benefited only top-level managers.
This, he said, led to the union taking measures to see the City acknowledge its fault. Mokgalapa tried to speak to the crowd but they started drowning him out when he didn’t announce the 18% increase Matlala said was agreed upon in a meeting.
Mokgalapa said discussions were not yet concluded and everything was scheduled to be ironed out on Friday in another meeting with stakeholders.
This, however, made the crowd unhappy and they ended up shouting down Mokgalapa until he went back into the Tshwane House building.
