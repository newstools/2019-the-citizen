The best-selling model in the Baoding based marque’s line-up with a reported 700 000 units sold globally since its introduction in 2016, the updates applied to the H2 are extensive in the form of a redesigned front bumper and fenders, restyled headlights with daytime running LEDs, a new hexagonal grille, revised rear bumper taillights, a chrome central bootlid strip, new five-spoke 18-inch alloy wheels, chrome faux diffuser and chrome tipped dual exhaust outlets.

Inside, the H2 gains upgraded materials, a new gear lever for automatic models and a standard sunroof across the range with a panoramic roof being available on the flagship Luxury.
In terms of range, the H2 is again split into two trim levels; City and Luxury with equipment levels being unchanged from the pre-facelift model. The same applies to the drivetrain where the 1.5-litre turbocharged petrol engine produces 105kW/202Nm, and can be paired to a six-speed manual gearbox or a six-speed automatic. As before, drive is directed to the front wheels only.

Available in a choice of eight colours; Brown, Hamilton White, Classical Black, Pittsburgh Silver, Atlantis Blue, Datura Red, Brown with a contrasting white roof and Red with a black roof, the H2 comes standard with a five year/100 000 km warranty and a five year/60 000 km service plan.
Somewhat surprisingly, no prices were revealed.
