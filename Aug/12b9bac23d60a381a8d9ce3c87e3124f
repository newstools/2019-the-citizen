Former Springbok prop and Bulls scrum guru, Daan Human, has back his front row of of Trevor Nyakane, Lizo Gqoboka and Schalk Brits to have their say when the national team takes on Argentina in Salta on Saturday.

South Africa can clinch this year’s shortened Rugby Championship title for the first time since 2009 with a bonus point win.

The 43-year-old, who played four Tests under Rudolf Straeuli in 2002, is credited with transforming the trio into arguably the best scrumming combination in 2019’s Super Rugby campaign, with Nyakane in particular carrying that form with him to international level.

“Trevor and Lizo started every game of Super Rugby, so one must feel satisfied with that. On the first day of the season one would not have believed that was possible. So I’m very proud of them,” said Human.
“I’m very proud of our front row. They worked very hard.”
The former Stormers and Toulouse loosehead though isn’t remotely suggesting that the Boks should underestimate the Pumas’ set-piece, despite their scrum struggling in the first two rounds of this year’s tournament.
He singled out talismanic hooker Augustin Creevy, who returns from injury this weekend, as a danger man.
“All these years we’ve known about the Argentina scrumming and Creevy is a meneer with all his experience,” said Human.
Yet he also notes that should Bok coach Rassie Erasmus select any of the trio later on Wednesday, they’ll hold their own against any scrumming assault simply because they keep it simple.
“That’s where our system had a good impact, they keep a straight back and attack, which is what I like, and they found their feet quickly.
“They’re not always going to go forward because it’s a team effort, but it’s easy with guys who want to listen, then the scrum is not that complicated,” Human said.
