Unveiled in production form in Shanghai on Thursday evening (29 August), with GWM referring to it as direct rival for Toyota (Hilux) and Ford (Ranger), the P-Series is claimed to “redefine pickup styles” with the newcomer also being the first to feature the marque’s new ‘P’ stylised logo said to represent Power, Peak and Perfect.
With the aim of selling 200 000 units by next year and three million by 2025, the P-Series will be made at GWM’s Chongqing plant and based on the automaker’s new P71 platform with dimensions of 5 410 mm in overall length, a wheelbase of 3 230 mm, height of 1 886 mm and width of 1 934 mm.

Although no outputs were confirmed, the marque has confirmed that the P-Series will be powered by the in-house developed 2.0-litre turbocharged engine, likely to be the same 180kW/350Nm petrol unit used in the H9, hooked to an eight-speed automatic gearbox with a torque-on-demand four-wheel-drive system being standard.
In terms of spec, the P-Series will come with features such as dual-zone climate control, Lane Keeping Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Departure Warning, a 360 degree camera system and a voice control infotainment system.
