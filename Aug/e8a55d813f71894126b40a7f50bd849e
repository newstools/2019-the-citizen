Police spokesperson Colonel Priscilla Naidu said a group of school children were walking home in Dyke Street, Algoa Park on Monday afternoon, when a confrontation started as the 13-year-old walking home from the shop neared them.
“The 13-year-old teenager allegedly stabbed one of the males from the group in his chest,” said Naidu.
The 15-year-old boy was identified by police as Jade Davis.
He collapsed and died after the confrontation.
