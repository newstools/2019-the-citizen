Topping the entry list will be championship leaders Neil Adcock/Michael Jensen (AidCall 247 Ligier Honda), James Forbes/Fritz Kleynhans (Point Blank Ligier Honda) and Sarel van der Merwe/ Riaan Botma (Auto Investments Ligier-Honda). A fourth AMC Ligier Honda will be in the hands of Romano Satori and Franco di Mateo.
The fastest car in the race should be the Maui Motorhomes Ginetta-G57 6.8l Chevy V8 of Craig Jarvis and Stuart White. Given reliability, it could win and set the day’s quickest lap time.
Other frontrunners should include Michael Stephen/Paul Hill (Kalex Aston Martin Vantage GT3), Sun Moodley/Andrew Culbert (Bigfoot Express Porsche 991 GT3), Kishoor Pitamber/Kris Budnik (Ferrari 360 Challenge), Howard Blake/Andrew Horne (Blake Digital Nash VW), John/Byron Oliver (Mega Pile Nash VW), Eric Salomon/Dave Sinclair (Elf S06 Toyota), plus the Backdraft Lexus Roasters of Trevor Graham/Brian Martin and Tony Martin/Mike McLoughlin.
The saloon car category should see a fight at the front between Dayne Angel/Jarryd Evans (Honda Civic Type R), Theo van Vuuren/Keagan Ward (FCA Alfa Romeo Giulietta) and Bradley Scorer/Darren Winterboer (Baron Motor Spares BMW M3). The Mopar Bigfoot Express 700 will start at 11.40am and will run for four hours.
It will be supported by a full programme of historic car racing. The Pre-1990 Sports and GT, Universal Health Pre-1980 Historic Racing Saloons and Charlie’s Superspar Pursuit classes are set to contest a couple of heats each, before coming together for a one-hour endurance race.
