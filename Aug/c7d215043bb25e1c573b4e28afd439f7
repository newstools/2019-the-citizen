Hawks spokesperson, Captain Matimba Maluleke said the suspect was arrested in Giyani by the Hawks’ Serious Corruption Investigation Unit members for allegedly impersonating a police officer.
It is alleged that the suspect attended to a complaint of assault and instead of escalating the matter to the police, he contacted the alleged perpetrator, identifying himself as a member of the local Public Order Police Unit.
He allegedly demanded R3 000 in order not to register a case docket of assault against him.
The perpetrator in the assault case alerted the Hawks who swiftly arrested the suspect after he received the bribe.
