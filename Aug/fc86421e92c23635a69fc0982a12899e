Speaking to The Citizen on the sidelines of the local launch of the updated Mustang this past week, Neale Hill stated that the intended focus of the Everest within Ford’s product line-up leaves little room for the introduction of an off-road bespoke model like the Ranger and the F-150 sold in North America.
“[I] am not really seeing that come to any fruition, purely on the basis that Everest and [Ranger] Raptor have two very different profiles in the portfolio and serve different requirements,” Hill said.
His comments comes after the automaker’s former Head of Performance, Jamal Hameedi, remarked that while no reason exists for there not being an Everest Raptor, “to do an SUV is a little more difficult because you have to figure out how to deal with the rear suspension”.
“In the form of a bodyside outer it’s not just a box outer [and that] poses a unique challenge in how you package that,” he told Australia’s drive.com.au last year.
