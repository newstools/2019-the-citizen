Aphiwe Dyantyi’s career looks set to come a screeching halt after the South African Institute for Drug Free Sport (Saids) confirmed that his B-sample has also tested positive for banned substances.
The Springbok winger had requested a second sample be tested following the revelation last week that his blood-work found traces of various anabolic steroids after he was tested during a national camp in early July.
He denied any wrongdoing.

However, the 25-year-old is now on the back foot as the University of Free State’s Wada-accredited laboratory confirmed both samples.
Traces of metandienone, methyltestosterone and LGD-4033 were found in his system – substances taken to increase testosterone levels as well as increasing muscle mass.
As a result, Dyantyi has been formally charged with doping.
The player, who was named World Rugby’s international newcomer of the year in 2018 for a sensational debut season with the Boks, can accept the charge and submit a plea for a reduced sentence.
Should he contest the charge, he’ll have to supply evidence before an independent tribunal panel at a hearing that should be convened within the next four weeks.
