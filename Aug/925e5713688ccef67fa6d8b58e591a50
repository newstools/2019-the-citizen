Codenamed ‘Godzilla’ and joining the existing 6.2-litre petrol and the 6.7-litre Powerstroke turbodiesel V8, the 7.3 not only rates as one of the biggest production engines in the world today, but also replaces the 6.8-litre Triton V10 that first debuted in 1997.

Eclipsing the 6.6 and 6.4-litre petrol motors used in the Chevrolet Silverado HD and the Ram 2500/3500 Heavy Duty, the Godzilla comes in two states of tune; 260kW/635Nm for use in the F-450, F-550, F-600, F-650 and F-750 Medium trucks, as well as in the F-53 and F-59 rolling chassis’ and E-series, while in the F-250 and F-350, output is rated at 320kW/ 644Nm.

As a comparison, the 6.6 in the Silverado punches out 299kW/629Nm while the 6.4 Hemi in Ram delivers 306kW/582Nm. Equipped with Ford’s Power Takeoff system as an option, the Godzilla is paired to the now widely used 10-speed automatic gearbox that comes with five modes; Eco, Tow/Haul, Slippery, Sand and Snow, although in the case of the F-650 and F-750, the previous six-speed automatic has been retained.
Like with the F-150 however, the Super Duty will only be made available in left-hand-drive.
