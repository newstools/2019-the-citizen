According to goauto.com.au, the submission was filed with Australia’s property rights and legislation body, IP Australia, on 14 August and although it will be based on the flagship N-Trek model launched earlier this month, it is not expected to be a full-blown rival for the Raptor, yet.
Instead, the Warrior will more than likely be aimed at the Ranger Wildtrak and the Toyota Hilux Rugged in that it will add a series of cosmetic tweaks over and above those of the N-Trek, which closely resembles the Stealth (pictured) sold in South Africa.
Last year, the automaker’s Managing Director for Australia, Stephen Lester, said he has been in continuing talks with Nissan Global for the approval of an off-road focused Navara to boost sales in order to lift it from its current sixth best-selling pick-up position behind the Hilux, Ranger, Mitsubishi Triton, Isuzu D-Max and the Holden Colorado.
“I can show you pictures of the great-looking customer vehicles that I see around Australia at our dealerships and elsewhere of people putting all sorts of aftermarket packages, both genuine and non-genuine – of course we are pushing for all genuine parts,” Lester told the online platform at the time.
“What is shows and demonstrates to me very clearly is the enthusiasm of Australian consumers for this in the ute segment, and this would be an absolute killer if we can get something like that”.
Accordingly, the N-Trek Warrior could debut around October with pricing from $55 500 (R575 553), but expect it to be a market specific model and unlikely for South Africa.
