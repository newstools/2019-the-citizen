More than 600 arrests were made on Thursday as part of the Gauteng SAPS’s Operation O Kae Molao.
According to police spokesperson Kay Makhubele, the multidisciplinary operation started at 02:00 in the morning.
“Operation O Kae Molao is conducted every week around Gauteng and depends on the information gathered by our intelligence unit.
“Gauteng police, led by provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Elias Mawela and accompanied by officials from the office of the Premier David Makhura and MEC of community safety Faith Mazibuko resulted to the arrest of 573 wanted suspects. These suspects were sought for various cases such as murder, rape assault, robbery and malicious damage to property,” Makhubele said.
“Furthermore, two suspects were arrested for possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition, while other two were arrested for possession of drugs. Three liquor outlets were raided and closed down and 46 undocumented foreign nationals were arrested.”
Roadblocks led by women
During two roadblocks led by women, also conducted in Alexandra, four cars were impounded and suspected stolen properties were confiscated.
Makhubele said police visited a school where the majority of leaners were from disadvantage families, where they handed out 400 sanitary towels, 270 roll-on deodorant units and 250 squeeze bottles to the girls.
“In Ekurhuleni, ten suspects were arrested for possession of dagga during crime prevention operation in Kempton Park.”
The arrested suspects will appear in Wynburg and Kempton Park Magistrate’s Court soon, Makhubele said.
