The fourth round of this year’s Currie Cup kicked-off with another compelling escape act from the Golden Lions, who overturned a 0-19 deficit to eventually beat the Free State Cheetahs 24-22 in Bloemfontein.

The Pumas once again showed their relish for taking on the Sharks in Mbombela, memorably producing a stirring second half display to win 27-20.

And finally, Brent Janse van Rensburg’s well-drilled Griquas team shot back to the top of the standings with yet another superb performance away from home, punishing a tame Blue Bulls outfit to coast to a 37-15 victory at Loftus.
