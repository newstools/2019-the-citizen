Debuting on local soil less than a year after bowing in Europe, the updates to the five year old TT, which also includes the dropping of all Roadster models, are made up of the new corporate Singleframe grille, larger air intakes, standard LED headlights with optional Matrix LEDs, 19-inch alloy wheels and two new colours; Pulse Orange and Cosmos Blue.

In the case of the TT S, the aforementioned grille receives a Titanium Black finish with other cosmetic changes being the S line bodykit with wider side sills, a redesigned rear diffuser, full-length front splitter, new vertical air intakes on the flanks of the front bumper, Audi Sport 19-inch alloys, air inlets below the taillights and an exclusive Turbo Blue paint option.

The small updates continue inside where the 12.3-inch Virtual Cockpit Display is standard along with sport seats, which in the S features optional side bolsters. Also optional is a 12-speaker, 680-watt Bang & Olufsen sound system. A rear-view camera and Park Assist are the sole additions to the spec sheet with Audi claiming a total boot capacity of 305-litres.

Up front, both models are powered by the long serving 2.0 TFSI engine, albeit in two states of tune; 169kW/370Nm in the standard TT and 228kW/400Nm in the TT S. In the former, drive is send to the front wheels via a seven-speed S tronic gearbox, while the latter benefits from Audi’s quattro all-wheel-drive system and a six-speed S tronic ‘box.

A five-year/100 000 km Audi Freeway plan is standard on both models with the TT retailing from R670 000 and the TT S from R782 000.
