Essentially an appearance package similar to the four-wheel-drive FX4, the FX2 can be specified with 17 or 18-inch alloy wheels wrapped in all-terrain rubber, and which comes with a front undergaurd, an electronic rear diff-lock, FX2 badging and an off-road tuned suspension.

The interior meanwhile is kept unchanged with the same applying for the drivetrain, which combines the 200kW/420Nm 2.3 EcoBoost engine with the now widely used 10-speed automatic gearbox co-developed with General Motors.

Built at Ford’s Wayne Assembly Plant in Michigan, the FX2 Package is priced at $595 (R9 116) over the sticker of the standard Ranger, which starts at $25 395 (R389 102) for the base XL in Super Cab and tops out at $35 505 (R544 007) for the flagship CrewCab in Lariat specification.

Despite sharing the same T6 platfrom as the locally built, global Ranger and Everest, the EcoBoost powered Ranger will remain a US-only model.
