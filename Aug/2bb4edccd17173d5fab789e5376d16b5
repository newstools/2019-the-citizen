Police in Port Elizabeth are urgently trying to trace the parents of a two-year-old boy who died at Livingstone Hospital shortly after being brought in by a man on Tuesday afternoon.
According to personnel at the hospital, an unknown man brought the child in at about 3.40pm.
He informed them that the toddler had “fallen off a bed” and needed treatment, said police spokesperson Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg.
“While doctors were treating him, he died. When they approached the man to inform him of the death, he ran away.
“No information of the child or the man is known.”
Police have opened an inquest docket pending the result of a post-mortem report.
Police are appealing to anyone who may know the parents or the child to urgently contact D/W/O Neil Hendriks at SAPS Gelvandale on 082 442 1816 or Crime Stop on 0800 10111, or their nearest police station.
