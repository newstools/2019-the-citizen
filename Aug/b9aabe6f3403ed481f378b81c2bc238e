In an interview with Britain’s Autocar, founder Horacio Pagani said that the intended replacement for the Huayra, known internally as the C10, will make it’s unveiling around 2022, but with the option of an electric motor or a brand-new twin-turbocharged V12 once again sourced from Mercedes-AMG.
“We have a very close relationship with Mercedes already and this new V12 engine will be homologated until 2026. The C10 will have a regular V12 but, at the same time, there will be a full-electric vehicle. It is not going to be exactly the same platform. It will be modified,” he said.
Despite revealing the BC Roadster (pictured) some five weeks ago as the intended swansong for the Huayra, Pagani has alluded to that the model might go the way of its predecessor, the Zonda, in spawning a series of bespoke models well after the C10’s arrival due to customer demand.
“[The BC is) scheduled to be the last production model. But I am also listening to some private collectors who are asking maybe for a one-off or a limited edition, which will probably extend the lifespan a little more,” Pagani said, adding that the marque could even produce a radical model in the form of an SUV post 2025.
“If I had to come up with a Pagani SUV, it would need to have a price tag of €3 million or above to be in line with our current strategy. We don’t know if there is any market for such a product, but there could not be any compromise. It is something that has been discussed a number of times with collectors”.
