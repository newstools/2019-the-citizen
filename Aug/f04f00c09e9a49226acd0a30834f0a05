According to Britain’s Autocar, who also posted pictures of the prototype undergoing testing, the newcomer will allegedly be powered by the 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8 petrol engine doing duty in the M5, M850i, X5, X6 and X7, which will replace the long-serving 5.0-litre supercharged V8 built by Ford when the Blue Oval closes its Bridgend plant in Wales next year.
In addition, the current model’s aluminium D7u platform, otherwise known as the Premium Lightweight Architecture (PLA), will be replaced by the all-new Modular Longitudinal Architecture (MLA) set to be used by the Defender and all future Jaguar-Land Rover (JLR) models, whilst being similar in size.
As the MLA supports petrol, diesel, plug-in hybrid and electric drivetrains, the publication also claims that apart from the V8, all of the current engines will be phased out and replaced by a new range of straight-six Ingenium motors utilising a 48-volt mild-hybrid system. As with previous generations however, the Terrain Response off-road system and low-range transfer case will be standard.
While the all-electric model is only due in 2022, the ‘standard’ Range Rover is slated to arrive a year earlier, though expect more details to be revealed in the coming months as testing continues.
