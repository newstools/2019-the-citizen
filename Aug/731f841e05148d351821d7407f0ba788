The ANC has called for order, demanding the matter between president Cyril Ramaphosa and Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane to be laid to rest.
ANC Spokesperson Pule Mabe said the party was concerned at the apparent legal battle between the party’s president and the public protector.  On Monday, the Pretoria High Court is scheduled to hear Ramaphosa’s urgent judicial review application in regards to Mkhwebane’s Bosasa report, which relates to the leaking of confidential banking information of donors and recipients to the media.
The presidency issued a statement setting the record straight that their lawyers did not want the list of donors made public after confirming that confidential banking information about the contributors and recipients from Ramaphosa’s CR17 campaign were leaked to the media, on Saturday.
“The Presidency notes with grave concern what amounts to a violation of the constitutionally enshrined right to privacy. This is all the more troubling as it seems clear that this information had been, from the first instance, obtained in an illegal manner,” said spokesperson Khusela Diko.
Mabe, in a soundclip from the SABC can be heard expressing that the president had important matters to attend to, such as tackling issues that boost the economy to create jobs, and should be given the space to do his job.
