In a massive raid to seize counterfeit goods, police made a shocking discovery of guns and ammunition at one of the places they raided on Wednesday.

Rifles, ammunition, cartridges, radios and heaps of counterfeit goods were recovered.
In videos on social media, police can be seen going through heaps of counterfeit goods stacked to the roof of every floor in one of the buildings. One of the police officers can be heard commenting that the guns appear to have been smuggled into the country from Israel.


Police are targeting the same area they targeted last week Thursday, which resulted in some street hawkers retaliating with rocks, stoning police vehicles, resulting in police firing rubber bullets.
