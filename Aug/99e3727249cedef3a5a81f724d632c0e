Appearing near identical to the standard models on which they are based, the A250e and B250e are powered by the 120kW/250Nm 1.3-litre turbocharged petrol engine co-developed with the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance, albeit paired to a 75kW/300Nm electric motor for a combined system output of 160kW/450Nm.

Mated to the new eight-speed dual-clutch gearbox, the A250e will complete the 0-100 km/h sprint in 6.6 seconds, the A250e Sedan in 6.7 seconds and the B250e in 6.8 seconds. Respective top speeds are 235 km/h for the A250e and B250e, and 240 km/h for the A250e Sedan.
While all three are limited to 140 km/h in electric mode, the A250e has a rated maximum all-electric range of 68 km, the A250e Sedan 69 km and the B250e 67 km according to the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP) regulations that come into being in Europe on 1 September last year. Using a 7.4 kW Wallbox will result in a total charging time of one hour 45 min from flat to 100%.

In Germany, prices start at €36 943 (R629 235) for the A250e and at €37 300 (R635 316) for the A250e Sedan, with both already being available. The B250e meanwhile will arrive within the next few weeks priced from €37 663 (R641 499). At present, neither are earmarked for South African availability.
