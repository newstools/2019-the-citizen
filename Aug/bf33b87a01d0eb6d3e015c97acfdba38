Repairs to a burst pipe on a main Rand Water pipeline will affect various parts of Kempton Park as well as surrounding areas.
Justice Mohale, spokesperson for Rand Water, on Saturday at noon said accurate timelines would only be known later.
Rand Water experienced a burst on its O2 pipeline and immediately diverted supply to the O5 pipeline.
“The repair will require that a number of valves be closed in order for the pipeline to drain speedily, as well as to sure a safe working environment for technicians. The O2 pipeline also crosses a river stream and technicians have begun diverting the flow of the stream,” said Mohale.
“Our preliminary assessment indicates that a number of areas will be affected during the repair process. We will communicate accurate timelines as soon as we achieve the first milestone of the repair process.”
