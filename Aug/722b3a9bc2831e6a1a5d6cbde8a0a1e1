According to the BMW Blog, the model in question will reportedly be called i7 which will share the next Seven’s platform, but have the option of at least three outputs ranging from a 80 kWh to a 120 kWh battery pack.
Allegedly, the report states that the i7 will incorporate BMW’s so-called “next level batteries” with the expected 120 kWh model set to offer a claimed range of up to 700 km on a single charge, and produce as much as 650 horsepower or 485 kW.
With the new 7 Series set to debut either next year or in 2021, expect the i7 to follow soon after.
