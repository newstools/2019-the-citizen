According to the claims by Autocar, the alleged Xrio could serve as a supplement for the Stonic (main) introduced last year, although it is not expected to feature the same seating arrangement, which, accordingly, is how the automaker defines its SUVs/crossovers.
“What we are looking at is whether the market is going to split into low and high seating positions for SUVs and crossovers and whether we need five models to cover the market or four and whether some should be electric or not,” the automaker’s European Head of Product Planning, David Labrosse, told the publication.

With Kia classifying SUVs as B-High/B-Low and C-High/C-Low, the Xrio is slated to become its B-High offering as the B-Low is being occupied by the Stonic, C-Low by the XCeed and the C-High by the ageing Sportage and hybrid/electric Niro. The Seltos meanwhile will not be available in Europe as it has been earmarked for developing markets such as India and of course, South Africa.
“Nothing is decided, but that’s a decision on the table right now,” the automaker’s Chief Operations Officer for Europe, Emilio Herrera, was quoted as saying of the Xrio.
