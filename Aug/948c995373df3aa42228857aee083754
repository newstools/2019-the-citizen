15 –  DILLYN LEYDS (WESTERN PROVINCE)
He simply had way too much class for an embattled Pumas defence.
14 – CORNAL HENDRICKS (BLUE BULLS)
Arguably the best wing in the country outside the men in the Springbok camp. Not only an attacking force, he looks for other work as well.
13 – RUHAN NEL (WESTERN PROVINCE)
Continues to dominate at Currie Cup level with his sevens trickery, though this performance was illuminated by some superb tackling.
12 – JEREMY WARD (SHARKS)
His leadership responsibilities have clearly inspire him to be the mainstay of the Durbanites’ backline, be it on attack or defence.
11 – LWAZI MVOVO (SHARKS)
He shows the value of experienced players keeping the Currie Cup competitive as well as mentorship weekly.
10 – MANIE LIBBOK (BLUE BULLS)

The mercurial pivot is known for his X-factor, but at Ellis Park he showed some real class by just controlling things well.
9 – SANELE NOHAMBA (SHARKS)
He’s still only 20 years old and still raw, but his basics stood out at the weekend, particularly his crisp, accurate service.
8 – SIKHUMBUZO NOTSHE (WESTERN PROVINCE)
Not only was it almost impossible to bring him down in open play, it was impossible to stay on your feet when he was tackling you.
7 – ERNST VAN RHYN (WESTERN PROVINCE)
The Cape’s flank factory has turned out yet another gem. His robustness is impressive.
6 – PHEPSI BUTHELEZI (SHARKS)
The hype around the Junior Springbok captain is real.
5 – RUAN NORTJE (BLUE BULLS)
Steadily finding the type of form that suggests he could become a key figure in next year’s Super Rugby campaign.
4 – RUBEN VAN HEERDEN (SHARKS)

Former Bulls coach John Mitchell replaced him after 22 minutes in Super Rugby last year because of his poor defence. Now, he averages an incredible 18 tackles per game.
3 – COENIE OOSTHUIZEN (SHARKS)
Even if he doesn’t make the Springboks’ World Cup squad, he’s leaving Kings Park on a high.
2 – JOHAN GROBBELAAR (BLUE BULLS)

Much in the mould of Akker van der Merwe, this energetic, compact hooker packs a real punch.
1 – CORNE FOURIE (WESTERN PROVINCE)
The type of reliable workhorse any team cherishes.
