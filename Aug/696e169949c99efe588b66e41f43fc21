A nine-year-old girl was hospitalised on Tuesday afternoon following a freak accident at a school in Carletonville.
ER24 medics arrived on the scene at 3.04pm to find that the girl had impaled her hand on a palisade fence, said ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring.
Members of the public had gathered and were assisting the child.
Medics utilised a grinder that had been brought by a member of the public and began cutting the fence.
After a short time, medics removed the section of the fence, freeing the girl.
She was treated for her injury and thereafter transported to a nearby hospital for further care.
It is believed that the girl had attempted to climb over the fence when she slipped and fell.
The exact details are not yet known.
