Essentially a rebadged version of Chinese parent company SAIC’s Maxus T70, itself a rejigged take on the earlier T60 that debuted three years ago and sold as the LDV T60 in Australia, the Extender mainly receives a new, MG bespoke grille with the rest being unchanged from the T70.

Directly aimed at the Toyota Hilux, Ford Ranger, Isuzu D-Max, Nissan Navara and Mitsubishi Triton in the lucrative Thai bakkie market, the Extender will be offered in extended cab and double bodystyles with a choice of two diesel engines displacing 2.0-litres; a single turbo developing 120kW/375Nm and a twin-turbo producing 160kW/480Nm.

Depending on the engine and trim level, the Extender will come with a either a six-speed manual or six-speed automatic gearbox with drive going to the rear or all four wheels.

In Thailand, pricing for the Extender kicks-off at 549 000 baht (R272 564) for the extended cab at 759 000 (R371 859) baht for the double cab, but, although available in right-hand-drive, it is not expected to touchdown in South Africa anytime soon.
