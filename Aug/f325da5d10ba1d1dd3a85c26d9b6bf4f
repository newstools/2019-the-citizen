Footage of a couple calmly forcing three security personnel to the ground has surfaced.
The video shows a man and woman calmly walking into the control room and forcing three men inside what appears to be a security office to the floor.
The CCTV footage shows the perpetrators calmly showing the security guards their firearms before they enter the control room to search the defenceless guards. The woman can be seen pacing in and out of the room as though to ensure there were no witnesses.
Soon, a fourth security guard emerges from outside, to enter the control room. He soon realises the danger he has walked into and immediately drops to the floor to cover his head.
The culprits proceed with their hostile takeover. It is unclear if anyone was injured during the alleged armed robbery. According to a voice in the footage, the owners of the footage want the footage to be shared on social media as an attempt to catch the couple responsible.
A caption on the video suggests the footage was at a depot in Jet Park.
