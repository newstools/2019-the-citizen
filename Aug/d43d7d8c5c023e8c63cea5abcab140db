Police in Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal are appealing for the public’s assistance in finding the family of a teenager who walked into the station claiming she was lost.
Police says that according to 13-year-old Simphiwe Zwane, her parents are Sifiso Zwane [father] and Nonsikelelo Manqele who work at the Ethekwini Municipality.
