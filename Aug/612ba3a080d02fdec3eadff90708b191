Springbok management on Monday confirmed that Marcell Coetzee will undergo ankle surgery on Wednesday.
The Ulster looseforward hurt his ankle and also suffered a blow to the head in the first half of the Springboks’ 24-18 victory over Argentina in Pretoria.
He will be out of action for up to 12 weeks, which means he is also ruled out of contention for selection for the Springboks’ World Cup squad.
It’s yet another slice of cruel luck for the 28-year-old, who mildly controversially missed out on a trip to the 2015 edition and struggled the best part of two years to get over a chronic knee problem.
Lizo Gqoboka (Blue Bulls), Marvin Orie (Golden Lions), Thomas du Toit and André Esterhuizen (both Sharks) have been released from the Springbok training squad back to their provinces and will be available for Currie Cup selection this weekend.
The four are members of the Springbok training squad of 36 players who gathered in Bloemfontein on Sunday for the start of a four-day Rugby World Cup camp. They will join their provinces on Tuesday.
The Springbok RWC squad announcement takes place on Monday, 26 August, at 15h00 in Johannesburg.
