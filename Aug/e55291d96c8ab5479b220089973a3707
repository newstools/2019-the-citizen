Set to make its public debut at the Kyalami Festival of Motoring at the end of this month, the A1, once again, uses the same platform as the Volkswagen Polo and forthcoming T-Cross, the MQB A0, but which is 56 mm longer than before. Boot space is rated at 335-litres but expands to 1 090-litres with the rear seats folded down.
For South Africa, the A1 range will compromise, based on the automaker’s online configurator, out of seven models with a choice of three trim levels; base, Advanced and S line and three petrol engine options, all paired to the seven-speed S tronic gearbox with drive going to the front wheels.

Carrying the 30 TFSI badge, the smallest engine in the A1 displaces 999 cc and produces 85kW/200Nm, allowing for a top speed of 203 km/h and 0-100 km/h in 9.4 seconds. The step-up 35 TFSI utilises a 1.4-litre engine that outputs 110kW/250Nm, translating to a V-Max of 222 km/h and 0-100 km/h in 7.7 seconds.
At the sharp-end, the 40 TFSI comes equipped with the same 2.0 TFSI motor as the Polo GTI, and makes 147kW/320Nm resulting in a top speed of 235 km/h and zero to 100 km/h in 6.5 seconds.
In terms of equipment, all models come as standard with the 10.25-inch Virtual Cockpit Display instrument cluster, 15-inch alloy wheels, LED headlights with dynamic rear indicators, heated electric mirrors, standard or sport seats trimmed in so-called Delta, Derby or Novum cloth, leather wrapped steering wheel or the sports, flat bottomed wheel, manual air-conditioning or dual-zone climate control, a six-speaker sound system, MMI radio Plus infotainment system, cruise control and Hill Start Assist.

From the options list, buyers can have 16 or 17-inch alloy wheels (R8 300 or R17 400), folding and heated electric mirrors (R4 100), leather/leatherette seat trim (R12 650), yellow interior accents (R500), the ambient lighting package (R4 900), High Beam Assist (R2 200), the 10.1-inch MMI Navigation Plus system (R24 500), a 3D Bang & Olufsen sound system (R9 500), a reverse camera (R5 700) and rear parking sensors (R5 500).
Alternatively, the Audi offers the mentioned features as part of three equipment packs; the Light Pack (R14 900), Technology (R9 900), Comfort (R10 300) and Sports (R14 700).
In total, the A1 will have the option of nine colours; Cortina White, Tioman Green, Glacier White Metallic, Myth Black Metallic, Manhattan Grey Metallic, Firmament Blue Metallic, Python Yellow Metallic, Arrow Grey Pearlescent and Misano Red Pearlescent.
