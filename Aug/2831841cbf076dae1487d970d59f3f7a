The South African poultry industry is shooting itself in the foot by running a campaign of “misinformation” and paid lobbyists, according to the CEO of the Brazilian Association for Animal Protein (ABPA).
Speaking during a conference on the industry in Sao Paulo, Ricardo Santini did not mince his words about SA chicken.
He suggested the industry was its own worst enemy by choosing “war” over partnership with the largest meat exporter in the world.
This was amid a battle between local meat importers and the SA Poultry Association (Sapa) over the latter’s bid for a tariff hike for imported poultry products, purportedly in the name of fair competition.
While the application, which was on behalf of Southern African Customs Union (Sacu), did not purport to be targeting Brazilian chicken specifically, it sought higher tariffs on chicken imports from non-European Union trade groups.
The main complaint Sapa had was that the “flood” of foreign chicken was making it more difficult for local producers to compete against the often cheaper foreign birds.
“I want to help them, but I cannot help a country that is spreading misinformation and paying [lobby group] Fairplay,” said Santin.
