As of September 9, 2019, the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) will have a new chief operations officer (COO) following the resignation of acting COO and group executive of technology Dr Craig van Rooyen.
According to a statement issued by the public broadcaster, his resignation is due to personal and family reasons.


Van Rooyen said in a statement: “My decision to leave the SABC is one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make, due to my good working relationships at the corporation. The group chief executive officer, Mr Madoda Mxakwe, and the chief financial officer, Ms Yolande van Biljon, have made my decision to leave a particularly hard one.
“As executive directors, they have demonstrated a serious commitment to people, improving SABC processes, driving customer relations, and making the SABC financially sustainable. Moreover, having been involved in crafting the SABC’s turnaround plan, I am confident that the SABC will overcome its challenges in the short term and become successful in the long term,” he added.
According to SABC board chairperson Mr Bongumusa Makhathini, Van Rooyen played a meaningful role in developing the digital strategy of the SABC, including preparing the SABC for digital migration and becoming a multiplatform, multichannel player.
Makhathini said: “In the last three months, Dr Van Rooyen was also acting as the corporation’s COO. He has modelled the way for future COOs by demonstrating ethical leadership, technical expertise, and business acumen. The board is very sad to see him go, but wishes him well on his future endeavours.”
The SABC confirmed that the board would be interviewing potential candidates for the COO role this week, and would soon be advertising for a new group executive of technology.
