Accordingly, the entry-level XL comes with a new heavy duty suspension option consisting out of upgraded rear springs, new front and rear dampers, recalibrated ABS, standard stability control  and, on two-wheel-drive models, the same Bridgestone A/S tyres already available on four-wheel-drive versions.
In addition, both the XL and XLS receive the SYNC 3 enabled eight-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as a rear-view mirror mounted USB port that, based on customer feedback, has been added to support a dash camera unit.

At the sharp-end, the same USB port and bi-LED headlights are now standard on the XLT, Raptor and Wildtrak, while the latter adds the option of machined 18-inch alloy wheels and a powered loadbed cover controlled via the key fob or a button inside the cab. No drivetrain changes have however been made.
While Ford Motor Company Southern Africa has so far remained mum on whether the changes will come into effect on local models, expect it to be implemented towards the end of the year or in early 2020.
