Compared to its siblings, the Turbo’s unique exterior differences consist of a bespoke front apron, a fixed double wing roof spoiler, Sport Design side skirts and mirrors, 20-inch Turbo alloy wheels and standard LED headlights incorporating Porsche’s Dynamic Light System.
On the inside, the Turbo boasts the 10.9-inch Porsche Communication Management infotainment system, 18-way adjustable electric adaptive sport front seats, Alcantara roofliner, a 14-speaker, 655-watt Bose sound system and an optional heated GT steering wheel as well as a wireless smartphone charger.

Equipped as standard with the sports exhaust system, the Turbo also gets Porsche’ tungsten coasted Surface Coated Brakes claimed to not only aid braking, but reduce wear and dust emitting by up to 90%. Available from the options list is the full Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, height adjustable air suspension and Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus system.

With the latter figure being 29 kW up on the old Turbo’s 3.6-litre flat-six motor, the new Turbo sends its grunt to all four wheels via a seven-speed PDK gearbox incorporating Porsche’s Traction Management system, allowing for a top speed of 270 km/h and 0-100 km/h in 4.3 seconds.
