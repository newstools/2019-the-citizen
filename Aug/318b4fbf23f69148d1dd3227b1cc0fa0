Replacing the GL that has been the line-up’s range-topper until now, the GLX mainly receives upgraded features such as blacked-out the A, B and C-pillars, 15-inch alloy wheels, rear parking sensors, keyless entry, automatic climate control, push-button start and the same seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system that debuted on the Sport and Vitara Turbo.

No changes have taken place up front though where the 1.2-litre engine continues to produce 61kW/113Nm with the option of a five-speed manual gearbox or a five-speed automated manual.

Like the entry-level GA, GL and Sport, the GLX comes standard with a two year/30 000 km and for a limited time, a five year/200 000 km warranty.
