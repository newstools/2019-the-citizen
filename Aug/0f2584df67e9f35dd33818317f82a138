Slotting-in above the Trend and only offered in short wheelbase bodystyle, the Limited builds on the now mid-range trim level by receiving bespoke 16-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels, colour coded side moulds and a standard tow bar, while on the inside, the interior gets partial Salerno leather upholstery and heated front seats with 10-way electric adjustment for the driver’s chair.

Unlike the European Tourneo Custom however, the Limited, like the rest of the local line-up, does without a touchscreen infotainment system and instead retains the smartphone-styled dashboard like the previous generation Fiesta and Focus, which still comes with Bluetooth, USB and Aux inputs, as well as a six-speaker audio system.
No changes have also taken place up front where the new 2.0 EcoBlue turbodiesel engine and optional six-speed automatic gearbox offered on the Old Continent and Australia have both been eschewed for the locally built 2.2 TDCI motor that produces 114kW/385Nm, the same as the Transit Custom Sport, hooked to a six-speed manual ‘box.

Able to a brake trailer of 1 600 kg and an unbraked unit of 750 kg, the Limited has a payload of 939 kg and comes as standard with a four year/120 000 km warranty and a six year/90 000 km service plan.
