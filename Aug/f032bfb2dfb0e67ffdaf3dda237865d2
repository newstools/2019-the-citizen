Mobil 1 V8 Supercars.
The action started on Friday afternoon, when 72-year-old veteran Ben Morgenrood planted his Morgenrood Ford Mustang on pole position. He shared the front row of the grid with Franco di Matteo (Deltec Batteries Jaguar), ahead of Mackie Adlem (Adlem Auto Jaguar) and Terry Wilford (Fuchs Ford Falcon).
Saturday’s opening heat saw a tight dice between the front three, with the race lead changing on a number of occasions. In the end, Franco di Matteo won, just two-tenths of a second ahead of Morgenrood. They were followed by Roelf du Plessis (LSP Chev Corvette), Adlem, Larry Wilford (Fuchs Ford Mustang), and David Coetzee (ELKSA Ford Falcon).
Saturday’s race victory went to Adlem, to extend his overall lead in this year’s championship. He was followed by Terry Wilford, Du Plessis, Larry Wilford, Di Matteo and Morgenrood, who felt under the weather and almost decided not to race.
Running behind the V8 Supercars, the Western Cape V8 Masters category also provided good spectacle. Fabio Tafani (Ford V8) took Saturday’s opening race from Sean Moore (Ford V8), Rui Campos (Campos Transport V8), Alistair Simpson (Ford V8), Brian Evans (Ford V8) and Fanie Theron (Ford V8)
