Like its panel van sibling, the Combo Life rides on parent company PSA’s EMP2 platform shared with the Citroën Berlingo, Peugeot Rifter and Toyota ProAce City, and provides seating for five with a claimed towing capacity of 1 100 kg for a braked trailer and 720 kg for an unbraked trailer.

Aimed at the Volkswagen Caddy and Toyota Rush, the Combo Life’s spec sheets consists out of a seven-inch Intellilink touchscreen infotainment system with Bluetooth and USB, cruise control, a tilt & telescopic adjustable steering wheel with volume controls, dual sliding doors, a six-speaker sound system, Hill Start Assist, ABS with EBD and ESP, six airbags, height adjustable driver’s seat with lumbar support, auto on/off headlights and traction control.

The change from panel van to MPV has however not affected the powertrain, which is made up of a 1.6 CDTI turbodiesel engine producing 68kW/230Nm, driving the front wheels through a five-speed manual gearbox. Claimed fuel consumption is five-litres/100 km. Priced at R369 900, the Combo Life comes standard with a three year/120 000 km warranty and a three year/60 000 km service plan.

Shown at the beginning of this year at the Brussels Motor Show, the Zafira Life switches nameplates in that it now serves as an MPV version of the Vivaro panel van instead of the previous compact seven-seater based upon the same underpinnings as the Astra.

Also riding on the EMP2 architecture, the Zafira Life, in Europe, can be had with five, six, seven or eight seats and offers between 1 500-litres to 4 500-litres of boot space depending on the selected bodystyle configuration.

While pricing and spec is still unknown, the model sold on the Old Continent comes with a choice of three BlueCDTI motors displacing 1.5, 1.6 and 2.0-litres with outputs from as low as 70 kW to 130 kW. In some markets, a Dangel developed four-wheel-drive system is also offered.
