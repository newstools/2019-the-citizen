Building on the standard Cayenne E-Hybrid launched last year, the Turbo S swaps the 340kW/700Nm 3.0-litre turbocharged V6 engine for a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 combined with a 100 kW electric motor for a total system output of 500kW/900Nm. Hooked to the eight-speed Tiptronic S gearbox with drive going to all four wheels, Porsche claims a top speed of 295 km/h for both with the benchmark 0-100 km/h acceleration time taking 3.8 seconds.

According to the Stuttgart marque, the 14.1 kWh lithium-ion battery pack delivers an all-electric range of 40 km at speeds up to 135 km/h, and can be charged-up in full using the on-board 7.2 kW charger in 2.4 hours from a 400-volt power outlet. Using a 230-volt socket meanwhile takes six hours. Claimed combined fuel consumption for both is rated at 3.9 L/100 km.
Compared to the E-Hybrid, the Turbo S rides as standard on 21-inch Aero lightweight alloy wheels with 22-inches optional, while additional standard fixtures includes the Sport Chrono Package, the Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus system with rear differential lock, the three chamber Adaptive Air Suspension setup, Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes, Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control, Porsche Active Suspension Management, Electric Roll Stabilisation system and the Power Steering Plus setup with the rear wheel steering system optional.

In addition to the Turbo S, the Coupe now also comes in ‘regular’ E-Hybrid guise with the mentioned V6 engine resulting in a limited top speed of 253 km/h and 0-100 km/h in 5.1 seconds, which drops to five seconds with the Sports Chrono package specified. Fuel consumption is a claimed 3.2 L/100 km.
