Speaking to The Citizen at the unveiling of the updated Mustang in Cape Town last week, FMCSA Managing Director, Neale Hill, said that the Kuga forms part of a long-term plan within the congested C SUV-segment, and that the Blue Oval has no plans to abandon it or revert to the Escape moniker like in North America and Australia.

“We are not going to try and pull the wool over people’s eyes. Kuga has been a brand that has been established in South Africa for a number of years of now. Yes, it has had its challenges, but quite frankly, we would be disrespectful of the motoring public of South Africa if we decided to introduce a vehicle that is effectively the same by a different name,” Hill said.

In spite of the wraps having come off of the all-new third generation Kuga in April this year, no official local launch date has yet been revealed.
