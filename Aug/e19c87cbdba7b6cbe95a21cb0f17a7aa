Zane Waddell, South Africa’s latest swimming sensation, has joined a chorus of competitors who believe the controversy surrounding Sun Yang could’ve been avoided had doping rules been different.
The 21-year-old from Bloemfontein lit up a mediocre campaign for the country at the Fina World Championships by unexpectedly claiming the 50m backstroke title.

It was a heartening event given how Duncan Scott and Mack Horton’s refusal to acknowledge China’s Sun’s victories due to his previous doping violation dominated the headlines.
“I think it was more in protest of the doping system that could be improved,” Waddell told Sport24.
“I fully support Duncan and Mack because in 2014, Sun was caught with a hard drug. He tested positive and he served a ban. I’m of the opinion that if you have been found guilty of doping and, even if you have served a ban, you should not be allowed to compete professionally in the sport of swimming anymore.”
Sun is now subject to renewed allegations of further wrongdoing in terms of substance use.
Waddell admits that Sun’s outburst, where he shouted “You loser, I’m winning” at Scott, was understandable after winning the 200m freestyle as “there’s plenty of emotion that comes into play”, but maintains the 27-year-old shouldn’t have been present anyway.
He also revealed that he took inspiration from the Springboks’ brave, last-gasp draw against the All Blacks before the defining moment of his career to date.

“I was confident in my training and the work that my coach and I had done and I had an inner-belief that I was going to get my hand on the wall first. When I finished the splash and dash, I looked up at the scoreboard and saw the number one next to my name. I was overcome with raw emotion when I won and all I could do was scream and splash the water.
“I have to attribute some of my energy to the Springboks.”
