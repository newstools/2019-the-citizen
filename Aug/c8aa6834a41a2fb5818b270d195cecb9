While temperatures in South Africa are moderate at the moment, winter is far from over, according to the South African Weather Service.
The service says a number of cold fronts are expected this month.
Weather forecaster Edward Engelbrecht said the warm temperatures at the moment, especially in the northeastern parts of the country where temperatures were in the mid-20s, would only last for the next three to four days.
He said a cold front is bringing in lower temperatures throughout the country at the beginning of next week.

“We are expecting a cold front from the Western Cape and Eastern Cape that will spread northeasterly. This will drop temperatures from Monday and Tuesday next week.
“Rain is also expected in the northwestern parts of the country including the North West and Free State and in parts of Mpumalanga and Gauteng.
“Winter is definitely not over as cold fronts will be making landfall throughout August and maybe in the beginning of September.
“Temperatures are only expected to warm up towards the end this month,” Engelbrecht said.
