This, according to the automaker’s Sales and Marketing Head for Europe, Matthew Harrison, who told Automotive News Europe this past week that while Toyota’s overall sales on the Old Continent now includes 50% hybrid vehicles, it remains committed to offering models with “excitement” and “emotion”.
“Being strong in hybrids doesn’t mean we have given up dreaming about having extremely exciting performance products to drive. We are trying to build more of an obvious link to the GR brand, which is why we are establishing for each of our core models a GR Sport derivative. Some of the hybrid models will have a GR grade,” Harrison said.
“When we started with the first-generation Prius, the design was fairly rational to say the least, and the driving experience was a bit uninspiring. So, we invested hugely in core hybrid models to make them the best-looking derivatives in the range”.
Harrison’s comments comes mere months after Toyota unveiled GR Sport versions of the new Corolla (pictured) at the Geneva Motor Show, powered by the 90 kW 1.8-litre hybrid or 132 kW 2.0-litre hybrid engines with a number of bespoke interior and exterior tweaks.
At present, these models are unlikely for South Africa with the current GR range consisting out of the Supra and the GR Sport out of the limited-run Hilux.
