Bringing the petrol fuelled X5 range to three after the xDrive 40i and the xDrive 50i, the 45e replaces the previous 40e and also swaps the four-cylinder engine for a bigger six-cylinder combined with a more powerful electric motor.
Displacing 3.0-litres, the turbocharged straight-six produces the same 250kW/450Nm as the 40i, but combines this with a 24 kWh lithium-ion battery pack that produces 83 kW, meaning a combined system output of 290kW/600Nm.
Paired to the carryover eight-speed Steptronic gearbox, the 45e will dash from 0-100 km/h in 5.6 seconds, 1.2 seconds faster than the 40e, and reach a limited top speed of 235 km/h. According to BMW, the all-electric range is 97 km/h with emissions free driving possible at speeds up to 135 km/h. Claimed fuel consumption is 1.7 L/100 km with emissions of 39 g/km.
As mentioned, the 45e will make its local market debut in the fourth quarter of 2019 with pricing set yet to be confirmed then, however, expect it to slot-in between xDrive 30d M Sport that retails from R1 253 196 and the M50d priced from R1 502 582.
