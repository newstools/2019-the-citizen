15 – TYRONE GREEN (GOLDEN LIONS)
Slippery as ever and rounded off his try very well. Some neat moments on defence as well, including two dominant tackles despite his small frame.
14 – MADOSH TAMBWE (GOLDEN LIONS)
Deserves credit for scoring his side’s crucial try on the half-time whistle and is beginning to increase his work rate, particularly on when he’s on the back foot.
13 – RYAN NELL (PUMAS)

If there was ever the rugby equivalent of a captain’s innings, his showing against the Sharks was it.
12 – ANDRE SWARTS (GRIQUAS)
An underrated powerhouse who flourishes with ball in hand and when he’s required to cage his opponents.
11 – STEAN PIENAAR (GOLDEN LIONS)
This sturdy winger definitely announced himself to the broader public with an all-action performance in Bloemfontein.
10 – GEORGE WHITEHEAD (GRIQUAS)
Unfashionable yet so effective. This is a man who knows his game inside-out.
9 – ZAK BURGER (GRIQUAS)

This young scrumhalf has ‘Springbok’ written all over him. And that’s not hyperbole.
8 – HACJIVAH DAYIMANI (GOLDEN LIONS)
In two weeks, this explosive exponent has become one of the anchors of his team’s pack. He delivered the vital scoring pass that got the Lions back in the game, he stole lineouts, won two turnovers and defended like a champ.
7 – JEANDRE RUDOLPH (PUMAS)

He’s performed at another level since finding his niche as an eighthman. He was too good leave out and is accommodated at blindside, where he’s played before.
6 – MARNUS SCHOEMAN (GOLDEN LIONS)
Given his consistency to date, he’s arguably the most valuable player in this year’s tournament to date.
5 – STEFAN WILLEMSE (PUMAS)
Considered a bit small to play lock, this former Kings stalwart is proving critics wrong. Six monstrous tackles epitomised the Pumas’ spirit on the day.
4 – IAN GROENEWALD (GRIQUAS)
He did his best work out of sight, and that’s the definition of a workhorse lock. He provided grunt and kept the Bulls out with 14 tackles.
3 – RUAN KRAMER (GRIQUAS)
He certainly didn’t expect to play more than 50 minutes as a substitute, but made sure he’s now pushing for a starting spot.
2 – JOSEPH DWEBA (FREE STATE CHEETAHS)
He didn’t always protect his possession well, but that can’t overshadow what was a fiery performance, particularly in open play.

An absolute workhorse on defence, a strong carrier and a man treasured for doing the basics so well.
