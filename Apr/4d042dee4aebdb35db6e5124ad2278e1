Toyota has refreshed its pioneering Prius with a new sense of style and a simplified design language.
With cleaner and more engag- ing lines, the Toyota hybrid halo fi ve-door hatch features new front and rear treatment as well as sharper, sleeker headlights and rear combination lights.
Inside, the cabin incorporates design tweaks to improve ergonomics and changes to the interior trim whilst retaining the luxurious black leather upholstery. Priced at R490 200, the updated Prius hatch features restyled front and rear bumpers that give it a more dynamic flowing appearance that is further enhanced by its slightly longer (+35mm) overall length.
New slimline headlights with bi-beam LEDs and a revised lower intake accentuate the sharper, sleeker aesthetic. A change to LED fog lamps unifies the front-light signature. The new platform perfectly complements the latest generation petrol-electric hybrid drive- train combining a 1.8-litre Atkin- son cycle petrol engine with two motor generators to provide the optimum balance of performance and fuel efficiency depending on driving behaviour and road conditions. The total system output is quoted as 100kW. Fuel consumption for the combined cycle is specified as 3.7 litres per 100 km.
