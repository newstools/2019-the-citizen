National police spokesperson Colonel Brenda Muridili said the vehicle was hit at about 10:00 on Friday while travelling on the N1 north near the Hammanskraal off-ramp.
“A vehicle allegedly drove into the armoured vehicle and the impact caused the AV to roll,” said Muridili.
“Another vehicle, an SUV, also came from the same direction and stopped at the scene. Three suspects, all armed with rifles, got out of their car and approached the AV. The suspects allegedly used explosives to bomb the AV and fled the scene with an undisclosed amount of money.
“The guards were all taken to hospital for the injuries sustained when their vehicle rolled.”
On Friday morning, security company SBV services confirmed that one of its vans had been hit in the heist.
