As the euphoria of the Springboks’ World Cup triumph continues to subside in general, there’s one man who’ll make sure the momentous achievement is celebrated as long as possible.
Unsurprisingly, that man is Faf de Klerk.
Despite being in the employ of an English club, the diminutive Bok scrumhalf is apparently still trolling his Sale Sharks teammates over England’s comprehensive 12-32 loss in the final.

In fact, the 27-year-old cheekily picked out one of the men to take the defeat the hardest, 21-year-old flanker Tom Curry, to rub salt into the still fresh wound.
During a team meeting earlier this week, De Klerk sneaked up to Curry and draped his winner’s medal over him.
“I don’t think he even said ‘Hi’. He just put it there,” Curry told The Times.
“I just wanted to show my medal to Tom,” was De Klerk’s reply on the incident.
Talking of incidents, the two men created one of the more compelling photographic moments of the final when grabbed each other by the collar.
But the details of that exchange will remain sketchy.
“We just smiled at each other, didn’t we?” said Curry.
Never to leave things hanging, De Klerk chipped in: “Yeah, it was nice to see him.”
