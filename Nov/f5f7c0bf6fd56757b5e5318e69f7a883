An accident scene in which the occupants suffered only minor injuries turned into a murder scene last Sunday, reports Lowvelder.
The incident occurred at around 3am when two vehicles were involved in a partial head-on collision on the R40 between Hazyview and White River.
In a macabre twist to a run-of-the-mill accident, one of the drivers emerged from the wreckage and allegedly killed the other by strangulation.
According to the Mpumalanga SAPS spokesperson, Brig Leonard Hlathi, two vehicles with three occupants were involved.
“After the accident, the driver of one vehicle got out of his car, took off his belt, walked over to the other car and strangled the driver to death,” Hlathi said.
He said the deceased has been identified as 44-year-old Patrick Mnyambo. The accused, 64-year-old Victor Magagula, appeared in the Hazyview Magistrate’s Court last Monday to face a charge of murder.
He appeared again on Thursday for a bail application hearing, the outcome of which is not yet known to Lowvelder.
