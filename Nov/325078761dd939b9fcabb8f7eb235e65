Popular chicken franchise KFC is on the hunt for a couple who in video footage can be seen getting engaged in one of their branches. The footage shows a man on his knee, taking a ring from a box and placing it on his partner’s finger.
The franchise is looking for the couple and has asked the country to DM (direct message) them any information about the couple. KFC, in a tweet, pleaded with locals in the Vaal area for any information on the now engaged couple.
They clearly want to reward both the couple and even those who help to find them.
Watch the video below:

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonour others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 1 Cor. 13:4-8
