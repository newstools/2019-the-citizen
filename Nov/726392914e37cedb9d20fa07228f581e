The department of education has been fielding a plethora of cases regarding school violence in the past few months as school violence has been thrust in the spotlight.
Gauteng education MEC Panyaza Lesufi mentioned he would visit a school in Kempton Park on Wednesday where a pupil violently attacked his schoolmate.
It is unclear when the incident happened, but the footage was shared on social medial.
The department said: “The MEC has already confirmed that he will be visiting the school this morning [Wednesday] just to understand on what transpired there and what necessary actions need to be taken so that there is a deterrent to such action in and around our school.”
Last month a pupil died after being stabbed with a pair of scissors at the Thuto Tiro Secondary School in the Vaal.
