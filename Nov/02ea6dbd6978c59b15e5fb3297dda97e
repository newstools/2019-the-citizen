Time Master has not been at his best in his last two starts and there are two rivals in this race who have finished ahead of him.
On 7 October Time Master finished fourth and 4.75 lengths behind Eskista over this course and distance and 2.20 lengths behind Tina Bravada.
Time Master was clearly caught too far out of his ground that day and jockey Matsunyane is unlikely to make the same mistake this time around.
He was also behind Saint Marco when they meet last time out. Saint Marco is unreliable and seldom puts in two good performances in a row but back to Time Master.
Trainer Tienie Prinsloo has worked out how to get the best out of this four-year-old gelding and if he has sent him back over this distance, he should be the right one.
In a small field of only six carded runners Time Master could get ideally placed from a good draw.
The best bet on the card, however is in Race 3, a Maiden Plate over 1600m where Kayla’s Dream should prove to be a bit better than some moderate rivals.
Trainer Dennis Cason has got Kayla’s Dream to improve with each run and the step up to 1600m should be to her advantage.
Jockey Ryan Munger has been pretty good at Flamingo Park this season and Kayla’s Dream has the benefit of a good draw.
In a competitive last race (Race 8) the Stephanie Miller-trained All The Sevens can get involved with the finish once again.
This Seventh Rock gelding has been holding form nicely since winning at this course in September.
All The Sevens did well when runner-up behind Phil’s Power last week and drops in distance to 1200m this time and that could see him at his very best, especially as he has pole position draw.
