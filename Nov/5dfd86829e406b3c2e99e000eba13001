Mercedes-Benz is poised to give its iconic G-Class the plug within the next few years as part of its move to roll-out 22 all-electric models by 2022.
This, according to Daimler CEO Ola Källenius, who was quoted on twitter by the automaker’s Head of Digital Transformation Sascha Pallenberg as saying that, “There will be a zero-emission #EV version of the #MercedesBenz G-Class. In the past there were discussions whether we should eliminate the model, the way I see things now I’d say the last Mercedes to be built will be a G-Class” #AMWKongress #eMobility”.
According to carscoops.com, Källenius made the surprise announcement at the Automobilwoche Kongress in Berlin on Thursday (8 November), where he also admitted that attempts to discontinue the G-Class completely, first mentioned 2005 with the GL, now GLS, set to have been the successor, have however been put off.
“In the past, there were discussions whether we should eliminate the model, the way I see things now, I’d say the last Mercedes to be built will be a G-Class,” Pallenberg quoted Källenius as saying,
The electric switch, set to be the biggest transformation in the G-Class’ history since debuting as the Geländewagen or G-Wagen in 1979, comes just over a year after Product Chief, Gunnar Guthenke, told Britain’s Auto Express soon after the new W463 generation’s debut last year that the V8 engine will be kept for the foreseeable as “our customers love the V8”.
