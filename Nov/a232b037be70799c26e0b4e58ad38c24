Eskom announced on Friday that it had suspended its plan to cut power to the Mangaung Metropolitan Municipality.
This followed a meeting with the Free State MEC for cooperative governance and traditional affairs (Cogta), Skully Thembeni Nxangisa, which was held on Thursday “and a meeting held earlier today, [in which] Eskom and Centlec have reached a payment agreement”.
“Therefore, we will not be continuing with planned interruptions.”
The power cuts would have impacted Bloemfontein, Botshabelo, Thaba Nchu, Dewetsdorp, Wepener and Van Stadensrus.
