A 28-year-old man, identified by police as Brenton Wayne Williams, was sentenced to seven years imprisonment for raping his girlfriend.
Williams and the woman were only in a relationship for three days.
According to Brigadier Mohale Ramatseba, Williams said in the Galeshewe Magistrate’s Court that he raped his girlfriend after she refused to share sheets with him.
He was arrested on February 25, after she reported the rape to police in Galeshewe.
Williams was found guilty on one count of rape earlier this month, and will serve a seven-year prison sentence.
