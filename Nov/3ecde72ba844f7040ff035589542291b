The former South African Broadcasting Corporation group CEO, who once made headlines for going missing after a walk and later turning up in a hospital, Solly Mokoetle, has died.


Details surrounding his passing have yet to be revealed.
He was the public broadcaster’s CEO between 2009 to 2010 following a stint as chief operating officer.
Three years ago, a search for the former CEO was launched after he disappeared after apparently stepping outside his luxury home in Mount Edgecombe, KwaZulu-Natal, to meet someone at his gate.
He was later found by his wife, Zola Ntuli, in a Phoenix hospital just north of Durban in his pyjamas.
