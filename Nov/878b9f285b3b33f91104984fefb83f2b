Desolate Road’s victory at the end of 2018 was his only previous experience of a Graduation Plate and of being partnered by Anton Marcus.
The star jockey now gets aboard for a second time and being slung in at the weights this Pathfork gelding only needs to run to recent form to win this comfortably.
He is well drawn, has scored on the Polytrack, looks a five-star bet, and can be bankered in all exotics.
Marcus also has a stand-out ride in Race 6, where he gets on Sunset Eyes for Brett Crawford in a Pinnacle Stakes.
This twice Grade 1-placed sprinter is undefeated in two Polytrack starts and won the Listed Umgeni convincingly here last time out at the end of July.
He is another who is weighted to win and will be difficult to deny if not needing the outing.
A third to make strong appeal is James Peter in the opening race.
After two good trials Gavin van Zyl’s inmate was backed into the red on debut three weeks ago but was forced to settle for third.
That form line has already produced a winner and he should have come on for the experience. Jockey championship leader Warren Kennedy retains the ride and has a great chance of starting the meeting on a winning note.
