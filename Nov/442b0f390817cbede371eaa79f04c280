As the hours, minutes and seconds count down to Black Friday, many of you are steeling yourselves – as did the soldiers of old – to go into the battle.

Some of you will be camping outside the doors of major retail chains at midnight tonight, knowing they will open then – and that you won’t have to bunk work tomorrow to secure your bargains. Some of you will, no doubt, leave it a bit late and be swept along by the crowd-tsunamis.
At the end, there will be disappointment. Some good value items will be long gone by the time you reach the counter. Others will have been dodgily priced up a few days previously, to make the “saving” look all the more impressive.
