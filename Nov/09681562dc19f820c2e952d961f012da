After South Africa’s golfers wilted in the Sun City heat during the final round of the Nedbank Golf Challenge yesterday, Bafana Bafana stepped up to beat Sudan in an African Cup of Nations qualifier at Orlando Stadium. Bafana produced a far better performance in front of their home fans yesterday, scoring the lone goal through Lebogang Phiri in the 45th minute. While their performance was a step up from their showing against Ghana last week, they should have found the back of the net on more than one occasion.

Bafana produced a far better performance in front of their home fans yesterday, scoring the lone goal through Lebogang Phiri in the 45th minute.
While their performance was a step up from their showing against Ghana last week, they should have found the back of the net on more than one occasion. At Sun City much was expected of our local golfers after Zander Lombard took a one-stroke lead into the final round. Compatriot Louis Oosthuizen was lurking one shot off but the pair both struggled to find any real rhythm on the Gary Player Country Club layout.
England’s Tommy Fleetwood walked away with the title after winning a playoff with Sweden’s Marcus Kinhult.
Fleetwood, who entered the day six shots off the pace, signed for a wonderful final round 65. Brad Binder yesterday won his third Moto2 race on the trot, in Valencia, Spain. It brought down the curtain on his Moto2 career as he heads for MotoGP with the Red Bull KTM Racing team next year.
The cherry on top saw local cyclists Carla Oberholzer and Marc Pritzen win the 947 Cycle Ride in Joburg, ensuring SA sport finished the weekend on a high.
