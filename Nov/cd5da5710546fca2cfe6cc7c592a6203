Any boxer worth his salt will tell you that footwork is just as important as landing and evading punches.
But Innocent ‘Tycoon’ Mantengu is going to have to put on his dancing shoes twice in one year … at TWO of his own weddings!
According to Daily Sun, the 28-year-old professional pugilist, who earlier this year won and lost the South African junior featherweight title, has decided to marry both his girlfriends.
Mantengu apparently started a relationship with 22-year-old Nontobeko Zulu way back in 2012, before he sought pastures new and started seeing Nomzamo Mkhabela, who is 21, three years later in secret.
However,  Mkhabela didn’t want to end things, prompting Mantengu to take a gamble.
“I took a brave step and told Nontobeko about Nomzamo. At first she didn’t take it well, but with time they both learnt to live with it,” the boxer told the publication.
Now, he’ll marry both women within the next year!

“(The two women) visit each other. Even when I call them, I do conference calls and there are no secrets. We go on vacation together, and when I’m home we eat out with the kids. What makes me happy is that they help each other in raising our kids,” said Mantengu.
He also revealed that he’s a firm believer in polygamy.
“Growing up, I always wanted to have more than one wife, but I never thought things would start this early.”
15 December has been earmarked for his traditional wedding with Nontobeko, before it’s Nomazmo’s turn sometime in 2020.
Mantengu is a decent boxer with a 13 wins from his 20 professional bouts to date, a record that includes 5 KOs.
