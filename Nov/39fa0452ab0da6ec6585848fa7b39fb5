Subaru looks set to strengthen its ties with Toyota based on a new report from Japan that the next WRX STI might feature input from the latter.
According to Best Car, the so-called Agreement on New Business Capital Alliance plan, which kicked-off in 2005 and lead to the creation of the GT86 and BRZ, both of which will spawn all-new models in 2021, will result in the joint creation of a new electric vehicle platform, Toyota upping its stake in Subaru from 16.83% to over 20% and developing a new all-wheel-drive performance model using the latter’s rally-bred Symmetrical All-Wheel-Drive system as a base.
With a report from response.jp last year alleging Subaru possibly returning to the World Rally Championship (WRC) after bowing out in 2008 thanks to the global economic crisis, Best Car further reports that the deal will result in Toyota assisting with the STI in a joint-development role.
This will therefore not only lead to a new platform and next generation all-paw gripping system, but availability of the all-new FA20 flat-four engine that replaces the EJ20 which bowed-out in the limited run, Japan-only WRX STI EJ20 Final Edition last month.
In a related report, motoring.com.au alleges that the next WRX is only expected to debut in 2021 with possible electrification that could result in a considerable power hike over the current model’s 197kW/350Nm.
“Timing is a bit awkward, and we don’t have an exact date, but certainly not next year. We’re hoping it might be a 2021 issue,” Subaru Australia Managing Director Colin Christie was quoted by the online publication as saying.
In WRX spec, the rumoured hybrid powertrain could combine an electric motor with the all-new 1.8-litre engine that debuted in the prototype Levorg at the Tokyo Motor Show, the latter claim supporting that of the response.jp piece, although no confirmation of this has been made.
