The Fed atones for Wimbledon heartbreak 
Roger Federer produced a near-flawless performance as he avenged his Wimbledon defeat by Novak Djokovic and qualified for the last four of the ATP Finals with a 6-4, 6-3 victory on Thursday.
The Swiss started the tournament with a chastening straight-sets defeat to Dominic Thiem but found his best form when it mattered.
Defeat for the second seed spells the end of his bid to overtake Rafael Nadal and finish as year-end number one.
“Great atmosphere, great opponent,” said Federer, who hit 23 winners and made just five unforced errors. “It was definitely incredibly special. I enjoyed it from the beginning.
“I played incredible and I knew I had to because that’s what Novak does. It was definitely magical.” – AFP.

Vettel hits back at ‘immature’ Verstappen’s ‘cheating’ claims
Sebastian Vettel and his Ferrari teammate Charles Leclerc defended their team Thursday, dismissing suggestions that the Italian outfit had done anything suspicious to generate extra engine power this year.
Speaking ahead of this weekend’s Brazilian Grand Prix, four-time world champion Vettel declined to go into any detail, but made clear his feelings on “cheating” claims made by Red Bull’s Max Verstappen in the wake of the United States Grand Prix two weeks ago.
“I don’t think there is much to be said about it,” said Vettel. “I think that comment was very immature… I ignore it because it is irrelevant. We want to answer on the circuit.”
The German driver added that the Austin race was “not a good weekend for us” and said that “on top of the fact that we have a performing engine, we also have a car that I think is very efficient”. – AFP.
