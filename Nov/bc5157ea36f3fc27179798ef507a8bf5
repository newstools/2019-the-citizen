Toyota has officially confirmed that a performance version of the all-new Yaris will indeed happen based on a new teaser image released on Wednesday (6 November).
Although it was rumoured last month that a follow-up to the Yaris GRMN could happen, albeit under the Gazoo Racing (GR) banner as part of Toyota’s expansion of the moniker, the automaker’s European division has posted an image on its twitter page showing the Yaris GR decked-out in the same red, black and silver camouflage as the pre-production Supra, with the date of debut being revealed as 19 November at the Australian round of the World Rally Championship (WRC).
In what appears to be a ratification of Toyota wanting more four-wheel-drive models, the image sees the Yaris sporting the nomenclature GR-4, hinting that it could be an all-gripping model along the lines of the Yaris WRC that took Ott Tanak to the title this year.
While it is expected that the GR-4 will differ internally and externally from the standard Yaris, the choice of drivetrain remains unknown, although in Japan, the equivalent Vitz is offered with a 1.5-litre engine that will likely be boosted by a turbocharger instead of the GRMM’s 1.8-litre supercharged motor.
Despite the date, expect details and possibly even leaked images to appear online in the coming days and weeks.
