Two Glen Marais women were arrested after allegedly stealing their landlord’s car, leaving it at China Gate.
Benoni Flying Squad and a local security company recovered the stolen vehicle at the shopping mall in the early hours of November 25, reports Kempton Express.
According to W/O Grant Giblin, spokesperson for the flying squad, the black Toyota Yaris was stolen during the night of November 24 from a house on Dann Road where the two suspects rent a flatlet.
The flying squad reacted to a call from the security company.
Giblin said the suspects were spotted on CCTV camera footage taking the vehicle. After leaving the vehicle, they returned home, where they were arrested.
“It was found after one of the arrested suspects told officers where they had parked it,” said Giblin.
Two suspects, aged 27 and 38, were arrested on charges of possession of a suspected stolen vehicle.
