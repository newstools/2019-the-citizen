Nkosi Dumehleli Mapasa has been named as acting amaXhosa king.
This follows the death of King Mpendulo Zwelonke Sigcawu, 51, in a hospital in Umtata last week.
King Sigcawu’s funeral will take place on Friday, November 29, at the Nqadu Great Palace near Willowvale.
After the funeral, the process of installing a new king will start.
Mapasa, who is in his early 80s, will act in the position until after the funeral.
