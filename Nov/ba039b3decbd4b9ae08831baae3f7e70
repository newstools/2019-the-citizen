South Africans were given a glimpse of the latest addition to the Nyakane family after Springbok prop Trevor was caught on camera at Thursday evening’s MSL match between the Tshwane Spartans and Durban Heat in Centurion.
Chilling in one of SuperSport Park’s numerous suites, the 30-year-old World Cup winner looked extremely comfortable with his two-month-old daughter, Thando.
Asked a bit later by a SABC presenter whether he was more proud of his baby girl or his winner’s medal, Nyakane merely bellowed with laughter.

Look who we spotted at #MSLT20.

His wife, Gavaza, gave birth shortly before the Boks’ World Cup opener against the All Blacks in Yokohama.
Nyakane had revealed afterwards that he was truly torn between staying at home and returning for the clash with the old enemy.
“I can’t believe that someone I’ve only met two, three days ago, I can miss this much,” he said.
“It’s awesome being a dad, and I can’t wait to go back to her. I told my wife that usually I enjoy travelling. Now, when I was about to leave, I couldn’t let go of my daughter.”
As it turned out, fate had other plans for him as he sustained a calf injury in the match, cutting short his World Cup campaign and leaving him in tears.

He was back though five weeks later to join in the celebrations.
