Three such municipalities that may have their power supply cut off are Manguang (which includes the city of Bloemfontein) as well as the Mafube and Mantsope local municipalities, with power supply to be cut off for most of the day and the early evening by as early as December 3.
However, if previous examples of this behaviour are anything to go by, the action will likely end up in court, as happened in Newcastle this year.
The municipalities could be left without power between 6am and 8pm each day, bringing all the expected and attendant socioeconomic disaster, should they not reach payment terms with Eskom over coming days.
Customers supplied directly by Eskom, ie, not through the municipalities, will not be affected.
The Auditor-General was once again scathing of the financials of most municipalities in South Africa, including in the Free State.
