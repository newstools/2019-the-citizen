Nasal allergy sufferers in Durban are struggling to breathe as mould levels surged to a whopping 10,000 spores per cubic metre (m³) a day – the highest level of fungal spores recorded for the city in 30 years, reports Rising Sun Chatsworth.
A mould count of less than 900 spores/m³ is considered low, while a daily count greater than 2,500 is considered high.
Professor Jonny Peter, head of the University of Cape Town (UCT) lung institute’s allergy unit, explained that high fungal spore counts are typically associated with an increased risk of asthma attacks.

“Many fungal spores contain allergens, which can trigger a range of respiratory symptoms in those who are allergic, which include sneezing; a runny, itchy, or congested nose; coughing; sinusitis; asthma; and other bronchial issues,” added Prof Peter.
High levels of Alternaria, Cladosporium, and Epicoccum fungal spores have been found in the atmosphere of the city, exacerbating symptoms for the estimated 3,3 million hayfever sufferers living in KwaZulu-Natal.
A weekly airborne allergen count for Durban, which includes mould and pollen levels, are available online on the official pollen monitoring website for South Africa, Pollen Count.
Prof Peter recommended keeping one’s home dry and well-ventilated.
“A dehumidifier will also help to collect moisture from the air. Avoid drying clothes inside. Rather use a tumble dryer that is vented to the outside. Get rid of mildew on walls with cleaning agents and check your mattresses, pillows, and carpets for signs of mould to help limit your exposure,” he concluded.
