Rescuers are battling to put out a blazing tanker truck in peak Wednesday morning traffic on the M7 (Solomon Mahlangu Drive formerly known as Edwin Swales VC Drive), following an accident involving three trucks and six light motor vehicles.

A spokesperson for private ambulance and paramedic service Rescue Care, Garrith Jamieson, described the accident to Highway Mail as horrific in a video clip he sent from the scene while rescuers were working to help the injured and manage the scene.



According to Jamieson, all the necessary authorities are on the scene and will be investigating what led to the accident.
The accident has resulted in the Durban-bound lanes of the road becoming severely congested. However, the Pinetown-bound lanes have also been adversely affected by the accident.

People wanting to travel in or out of the city between Durban and Pinetown are advised to take another route until further notice.

At present, the Highway Mail has no confirmed number of casualties or injuries, but have been informed that at least one person has died in the accident. Two aeromedical helicopters were sent to help lift people who are injured from the scene to the hospital.
