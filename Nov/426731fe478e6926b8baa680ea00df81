Race 3 No 5 Outlandos D’amour
Dual winner Outlandos D’amour is yet to miss the first three in Port Elizabeth and if her rivals form is to be used as a gauge, then this four-year-old should win this contest easily.

Race 4 No 1 Luna Wish
 Alan Greeff-trained Luna Wish seemed to find the 1600m trip a touch too far in her most recent appearance when beaten into fourth by Viva Rio. This three-year-old should make winning improvement now that she steps down to a more suitable 1200m and is teaming up with an in-form Bernard Fayd’Herbe.
You can’t fault her form having recorded three wins, a third and two fourths from six appearances.
