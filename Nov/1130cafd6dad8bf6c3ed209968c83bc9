TAC hopes to attract new automobile manufacturers to Tshwane.
The Automotive Hub also forms part of the expansion of the OR Tambo International Airport Special Economic Zone, and is developed through a joint partnership between Tshwane, the Gauteng Provincial Government and the Department of Trade and Industry.
