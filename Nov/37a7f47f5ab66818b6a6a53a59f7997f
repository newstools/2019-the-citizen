Having divulged price and spec details on its website earlier this week, Kia has now officially locked-in sticker prices for the all-new Seltos.
Confirmed to arrive on dealership floors from Friday (15 November), the Seltos line-up will comprise three trim levels; EX, EX+ and GT-Line with the former pair being powered by a normally aspirated 1.6-litre petrol engine delivering 90kW/151Nm. On the EX, a six-speed manual gearbox is standard with a six-speed automatic optional, although the EX+ offers the latter as the sole option.
The flagship GT-Line meanwhile utilises a 1.4 T-GDI motor outputting 103kW/242Nm, which is transmitted to the front wheels via a seven-speed dual-clutch ‘box. It is also the only model to come with Kia’s three mode (Eco, Normal and Sport) Drive Mode selector, as well as a 2WD mode dial with three additional settings; Mud, Snow and Sand.
Arriving in the first quarter of next year though, the Seltos will feature a 1.5 CRDI turbodiesel engine paired as to the manual or automatic ‘box. While no technical details was released, local models’ sourcing from the Anantapur Plant in the state of Andra Pradesh will most likely result in the oil-burner being carried over from Indian-spec Seltos as models sold in Europe are powered by a 1.6 CRDI. In India, the smaller motor produces 85kW/250Nm versus the 100kW/260Nm of the latter.
