Influential Springbok flyhalf Handre Pollard won’t be seen on the Springboks’ World Cup trophy tour after being hospitalised with a broken cheekbone.
The 25-year-old posted a picture on Instagram in his bed, writing: “Not quite the trophy tour I had in mind. I would do this a 1000 times over to hold Bill again.”
Pollard, who scored 22 points with a superb kicking performance in the 32-12 win over England in the final, had sported a swollen left eye after the game, but clearly the damage was more serious.

His injury means his new club, French giants Montpellier, will probably have to wait a bit longer to hand him his debut.
Towering Bok lock Lood de Jager’s debut for English club Sale is also set to be delayed until the new year because of the shoulder injury he picked up in the final.
