Betting opens today at all Tabs around the country for the Bidvest Chris Gerber Gauteng Summer Cup over 2,000m at Turffontein – and there are millions to be won at this year’s race.
A field of 20 horses are carded to go to post on Saturday for this R2 million Grade 1 race.
This is the strongest field for many years.
Trainer Mike de Kock holds a strong hand with five horses, all of whom have winning chances.
There will be carryovers on two of the most popular bets Tab offers, the Pick 6 and the Quartet.
The Pick 6 will be kick-started with a R5 million boost and the pool is predicted to reach R15 million.
To catch the Pick 6, one needs to find the winners of six races – from Race 4 to Race 9.
The bet operates off a R1 unit and punters can take permutations.
The Quartet will have R2 mil-lion added and the pool is likely to reach R7 million.
One needs to find the first four past the post, in the correct order.
Once again, the unit is R1, and one can take permutations.
Horses from the De Kock yard occupy the first four spots on the betting boards, with Soqrat and Barahin joint-favourites at 28-10 with Betting World.
Third favourite is filly Queen Supreme at 7-1, with Cascapedia at 10 -1.
Durban-based Roy’s Had Enough, trained by Frank Robin-son, is at 12-1, while the next four spots on the boards are occupied by horses from the yard of champion trainer Sean Tarry, and the fifth De Kock runner, Atyaab.
