Steyn not done yet with Boks?
Frans Steyn says he does not know what his  Springbok future is.
The 32-year-old is only the second South African to have won two Rugby World Cups, having lifted the Webb Ellis Cup in 2007 under Jake White and then again in 2019 under Rassie Erasmus. Os du Randt is the other Springbok to have won two Rugby World Cups.
“I don’t know … I’ll have to wait and see,” was his response when asked on Monday if he would be seen in a Springbok jersey again.
The Boks have been on a five-day long trophy tour around the country that has seen them visit Johannesburg, Pretoria, Soweto, Durban, East London, Port Elizabeth and Cape Town.
The tour was incredibly well supported in every city with an overwhelming sense of unity evident along every route.
“It’s nice seeing the country like this,” Steyn said. “I think Rassie and them have a plan to keep that (unity) in place going forward. I really enjoy Rassie and the coaching staff. They’re honest and they know what they’re doing.” – News24 Wire

Rassie and Siya scoop top awards
Rassie Erasmus and Siya Kolisi capped a brilliant year for the Springboks by walking away with two coveted SA Sport Awards in Durban on Sunday evening.
Erasmus was named Coach of the Year, while Kolisi was voted South Africa’s favourite by claiming the People’s Choice Sports Star of the Year award.
“We are bursting with pride and would like to congratulate Rassie and Siya on the awards they won,” said Mr Mark Alexander, Saru president.
“Rassie took over during a turbulent time for the Springboks and through hard work and a clear plan, managed to win the Rugby World Cup and the Castle Lager Rugby Championship this year – a magnificent achievement. Siya’s credentials as a leader became more impressive each day and the way in which he took on the massive responsibility that came with being Springbok captain, was nothing by exemplary.” – Own Correspondent

South Africa’s Raven Klaasen and his doubles partner, Michael Venus, got their ATP Finals campaign off to an ideal start late on Sunday with a comfortable 6-3 6-4 over Rajeev Ram, a former teammate, and Joe Salisbury.
The fifth-seeded pair were in control from the start and will now face Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo as well as Ivan Dodig and Filip Polasek this week.
“We’ll take that every day of the week,” Klaasen told the ATP Tour.
“To be the first match of the Finals is a bit nerve-racking and to get off to a good start certainly puts our minds at ease for the rest of the tournament.” – Sport Staff

Federer ‘can’t lose again’
Roger Federer faces an uphill task to qualify for the last four of the ATP Finals after defeat by Dominic Thiem on Sunday following a masterclass by Novak Djokovic.
Six-time champion Federer was beaten 7-5, 7-5 in the evening match on the opening day after Djokovic had swatted aside debutant Matteo Berrettini in the earlier Group Bjorn Borg contest in London.
“Not allowed to lose anymore for me. That’s how it is every week of the year for the last 20 years, so from that standpoint there is nothing new there,” the evergreen Swiss legend said afterwards.
Djokovic began his quest for a record-equalling sixth ATP Finals title and sixth year-end number one spot a 6-2, 6-1 romp against Berrettini.
