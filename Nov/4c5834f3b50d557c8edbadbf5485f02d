Popular South African Portuguese restaurant chain Nando’s has once again had the nation in stitches with the made-up game that has taken centre stage in their latest TV ad.
The ad, which debuted today shows a group of South Africans playing a game of Mzansipoli, “the game of corruption, survival and confusion,” which boasts unique features such as corruption, repossessed land, squatter’s rights, white privilege and the race card.
Players have a range of character icons to pick from, like “black Twitter” and “the token Asian”.
Players are urged “to pay bribes and sow division in the game that will capture your imagination and the state”.
E-tolls, Eskom, and black tax also make an appearance.



The ad was well received and the word “Mzansipoli” dominated trends all day as various social media users shared their thoughts on the concept.

@NandosSA  brought us back to reality after we were blinded by the fake unity after the Rugby World Cup win. #Mzansipoli pic.twitter.com/S5COTxMS7r
