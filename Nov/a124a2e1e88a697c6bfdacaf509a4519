Mercedes-Benz has thrown out the possibility of the GLB going the electric route, or getting a more powerful version above the GLB 35.
According to Australia’s carsguide.com.au, the MFA2 platform the GLB shares with the A-Class hatch, sedan and the Chinese market A-Class Sedan L, as well as the CLA and forthcoming GLA, has not been designed to accommodate a mild-hybrid or plug-in hybrid drivetrain in its current form, and will therefore result in Benz’s smallest SUV being limited to petrol or diesel engines.
At the same time, Mercedes-Benz Australia representatives, when quizzed by the publication about the prospects of there being a GLB 45, confirmed that such a model will not be introduced as way of differentiating it from the GLA, which will once again spawn a ‘45’ derivative when its bows next year.
South Africa
Meanwhile, and in a blow for South Africans, Mercedes-Benz has stated that only two models will become available from the second quarter of next year; the petrol powered GLB 250 in front-wheel-drive guise, and the GLB 220d 4Matic. The aforementioned GLB 35 however has been ruled out completely.
