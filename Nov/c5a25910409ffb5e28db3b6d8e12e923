Springbok skipper Siya Kolisi is certainly embracing all the attention he and his teammates are receiving on their trophy tour.
During the national team’s flight for the Durban leg of their World Cup trophy tour on Thursday evening, the imposing flanker had lots of fun helping the on-board staff explain the flight’s emergency procedures.
Given that he’s already quite the jet-setter, Kolisi might have a career after rugby waiting for him!
