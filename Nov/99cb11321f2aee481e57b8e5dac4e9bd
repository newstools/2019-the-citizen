What is interesting is that no trainer is allowed to have more than one runner in the race – the same rule applying to the three reserve runners. In that way it gives smaller stables the chance to get a runner into the richest maiden race in the country.
The race was first run in 2012 and was sponsored by HSH Princess Charlene of Monaco with the whole concept of giving the underdogs an equal footing against the big trainers. 
“Since then, the race has been funded by trainers and owners through the nomination fee, as well as sponsors organised by Larry Wainstein (CEO of the Racing Association) and myself,” said Mike Wittstock, father of Princess Charlene, at Wednesday’s draw.
There were 64 entries for the race and 62 of them were still in at the declaration stage. However, once a trainer had a horse in the race, he or she was not allowed a second runner. 
The first 20 names drawn got into the field directly with the final three being the reserve runners in the order they were drawn.
