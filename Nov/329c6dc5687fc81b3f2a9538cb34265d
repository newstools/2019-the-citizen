On sale since 2014 with a subtle mid-life facelift (pictured) having taken place two years ago, Honda has confirmed that the fifth generation City, sold in South Africa as the Ballade, will make its debut in Thailand on 25 November.
According to Autocar India, the bigger sedan sibling of the Amaze is set to take design inspiration from the Civic, CR-V and all-new Jazz that bowed in Tokyo last month, with the biggest departure being the inclusion of a turbocharged petrol engine and a hybrid for the first time.
While technical details of the Jazz were largely kept under wraps, the publication reports that the City will conform to Thailand’s Eco Car regulations that offers tax benefits for cars falling in a certain category. In this regard, the normally aspirated 1.5-litre petrol will make way for an 88 kW 1.0-litre three-cylinder turbo closely related to the 95 kW unit sold in the European-spec Civic, paired to either a six-speed manual transmission or a CVT.
In some markets, Honda will also make the City available with a mild-hybrid powertrain derived from the Jazz’s e:HEV setup, which will allegedly displace 1.5-litres and paired as standard to a CVT, although a six-speed manual is rumoured for inclusion.
Carried over from the current City though will be the 1.5-litre turbodiesel engine that produces 74kW/200Nm. While only earmarked for India and with power and torque figures unlikely to change, the motor will be revised to meet ever more stringent emissions requirements. Like the blown three-pot, the diesel will have the option of a six-speed manual gearbox or, for the first time, a CVT.
Details surrounding the Ballade are unknown but chances are that it might continue with existing 1.5-litre motor teamed to either the five-speed manual ‘box or the CVT.
