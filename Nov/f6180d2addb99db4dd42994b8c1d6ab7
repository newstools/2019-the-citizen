BET Africa’s Lebo Mathosa biopic titled Dream: The Lebo Mathosa Story aired just as quickly as it was announced and it seems to have left viewers with mixed feelings.
The project was announced earlier this year with an initial cast of Kelly Khumalo and Bahumi Madisakwane both playing the lead role of Lebo at different stages in her life.
Madisakwane’s inclusion in the project was met with a large amount of resistance as was news that actress KB Motsilanyane would be taking over the role of the older Lebo after Khumalo was booted off the project for mysterious reasons.
The first episode of the six-part drama series directed by Portia Gumede aired last night and fans were live-tweeting their viewing experience.
Among the many problems that viewers had with the production was the casting. While some believed Motsilanyane lacked that X-Factor to portray Mathosa’s persona, others shared how they would have preferred to see a different actress in the role.

I told myself that I'd never watch any Lebo Mathosa biopic if Thandy doesn't act her role. https://t.co/erRAYFyjiB

Then there were those who didn’t mind the cast but felt as though something went wrong in the scripting or production of the show.

KB is fine, the cast is also okay…. Problem is the story line, maybe its the producers mar gonale something maan se se sent sharp, gonale something ga se get! #LeboMathosaBET pic.twitter.com/Tt0vNWfbIo

The biggest point of contention thus far, however, is the fact that Boom Shaka did not and will not feature at all in this iteration fo the Lebo Mathosa story.

If they don't include these champs then I give up , this is how most of us got to know Lebo #LeboMathosaBET pic.twitter.com/PP6csNZiwQ

KB pulled all the stops and you could tell she is there for all. Costumes/Outfits, The Hair and Choreography….I'm convinced. However; Production and storyline was a mess. Yesterday's episode was all over the place. #LeboMathosaBET #LeboMathosa #TheDreamLeboMathosaStory https://t.co/OQa6xKLVRC
