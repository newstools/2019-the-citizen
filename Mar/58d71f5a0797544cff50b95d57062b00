Marinaresco is in fine form and doing well, said his regular partner Bernard Fayd’Herbe who was cautiously optimistic over the 2017 Vodacom Durban July winner’s chances at Meydan’s Super Saturday meeting tomorrow.
Marinaresco has had two prep runs over too sharp a trip, and now lines up in the Group 2 Dubai City Of Gold, off at 4.20pm South African time, where the 2410m trip should be right up his alley.
He is drawn nine out of 10, but over this trip that isn’t too much of a disadvantage. “Marinaresco is in fine form and doing well.
It’s his third run after a long rest and we are hopeful. But it’s going to be a tough task taking on some really smart horses,” said Fayd’Herbe.
The $400,000 Grade 1 Jebel Ha a over 1800m goes off at 5:30pm.
De Kock has two acceptors. Here Majestic Mambo is a very interesting runner. Second in the Daily News and fourth in the July during the 2018 KZN season, he only arrived in Dubai in January.
As such, his preparation must have been a li le rushed, but the fact that he is running at all means that he must have been showing up well.
Fayd’Herbe rides this one as well, and they are drawn on the paint.”Mike has Majestic Mambo as fi t as possible, and he is working very well.
But it’s his first run in a very long time and in a Grade 1 race, so it won’t be easy,” was how he summed up this one’s prospects. Janoobi was third in this event a year ago, but has been well below that level in all four appearances at this year’s carnival and will need improvement to feature. Jim Crowley retains the ride, and they are drawn three out of the 10 acceptors.
