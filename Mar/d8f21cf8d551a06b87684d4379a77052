Following jockey Muzi Yeni in the Pick 6 at Flamingo Park looks the way to go today.
He will be tough to beat in Leg 1 (Race 4) when teamed up with Tienie Prinsloo-trained Space Warrior who contests a Maiden Plate over 1800m.
In two runs since joining Prinsloo, the gelding has notched up two thirds.
With the confidence gained, this six-year-old gelding could crack it with Yeni up for the first time and having the advantage of a good inside draw. But include the four-year-olds Great Success and Savanna Hawk.
Corrie Lensley-trained three-time winner Sussex (Yeni) will take some beating in Leg 2 (Race 5), a MR 62 Handicap (F&M) over 1800m.
This four-year-old finished in the money in her three runs this year with Yeni up, and could have the edge this time when stepping down in class. Consistent four-time winner For Ever (apprentice Nathan Klink) out of Bill Human’s yard could be rewarded in Leg 3 (Race 6), a 2200m MR 66 Handicap.
This gelding was a decisive winner in his penultimate outing and followed up with a second in a 1600m MR 71 Handicap.
Lensley-trained three-time winner Ataturk (Yeni) should defy top-weight in Leg 4 (Race 7), a 1600m MR 58 Handicap. His main rival is Miesque’s Speed.
Human-trained six-time winner Time To Be Great (Klink) makes most appeal in Leg 5 (Race 8), a 1400m MR 77 Handicap.
Others who come into the reckoning are Archilles, Secret Delight and Emperor’s Tractor.
Lensley has a strong hand in Leg 6 (Race 9) with seven-time winner Aramouse (Wes Marwing) and one-time winner Moroc-can Storm (Yeni) who line up in a 1200m MR 58 Handicap.
